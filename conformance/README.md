# RepoPact Conformance Suite

This directory is the versioned conformance corpus for RepoPact. It promotes the
fixture set from internal tests into a public suite that alternative
implementations can run.

The suite is defined by [`manifest.json`](manifest.json):

- `valid/` is a minimal conformant RepoPact repository.
- `invalid/*` are overlays on `valid/`.
- `rules` is the normative machine-enforced rule inventory.
- each case names the rule or invariant it exercises and the expected validator
  outcome.

The runner validates coverage in both directions before executing cases: every
inventoried rule must be referenced, every case rule must exist, and the repository
tests require every fixture directory to appear in the manifest. Reject fixtures
must yield exactly one reference diagnostic containing `expected_message`; expected
plus unexpected violations are a failure, not a partial pass.

Run the reference implementation:

```powershell
python -m repopact.run_conformance
```

Run another implementation by passing a command template. The runner replaces
`{repo}` with a temporary fixture repository path:

```powershell
python -m repopact.run_conformance --command "my-repopact-validator --root {repo}"
```

An implementation claiming conformance must accept every `accept` case and reject
every `reject` case with the declared diagnostic text after the fixture coverage
and isolation gates pass.
