"""Unit tests for import-plan narrative link rewriting (`_rewrite_narrative_links`).

Regression guard for the failure mode where `import-plan` lifted a plan README into
`work/<status>/<id>/` verbatim: relative links no longer resolved at the new depth,
and cross-item links kept pointing at the legacy plan tree that `takeover` deletes —
shipping dangling links throughout `work/`.
