# WI060 Architecture Baseline

Recorded before any code was modified, from completed WI055, WI057, WI058,
WI059, and Decision 0041.

## Current desktop crate shape (pre-WI060)

- `rust/apps/repopact-desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs` is the **only** source
  file in the crate. There is no `src/lib.rs` and `Cargo.toml` declares no
  `[lib]` target — only the default binary target. This is the standard
  desktop-only Tauri shape; Tauri's Android/iOS mobile runtime requires a
  `[lib]` target with `crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib", "rlib"]` and a
  `#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]` entry function, which does
  not exist yet.
- `select_repository` (main.rs:24-40) calls
  `app.dialog().file().blocking_pick_folder()` and then `.into_path()` on the
  result. `blocking_pick_folder()` is `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s desktop folder
  picker. Tauri's Android dialog implementation does not implement folder
  selection at all — Android's OS-level folder concept for third-party apps
  is the Storage Access Framework's `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`, which does
  not return a filesystem path but a `content://` URI scoped by the
  document-tree grant. `into_path()` has no way to produce a real recursive
  filesystem directory from that URI even if the picker existed on Android.
- `DesktopService::open_repository` (repopact-desktop-api/src/lib.rs:420-450ish)
  takes a `PathBuf` and constructs a `Repository`/`RepositorySession` directly
  from it — it fundamentally consumes a filesystem directory. There is no
  document-tree or URI-based repository abstraction anywhere in the reusable
  Rust core.
- `repopact_repository::git::NativeGitRunner` invokes an external `git`
  executable via `std::process::Command::new("git")` (through the approved
  process-containment helper). Ordinary Android application packages do not
  ship or have access to a system `git` binary; nothing in the current
  bring-up plan assumes one is available inside the Android app process.
- RepoPact's repository/topology discovery is nonetheless resilient to the
  absence of `.git`: `RepositoryTopology::build` gates every Git query on
  `repository.root.join(".git").exists()` first (see
  `rust/crates/repopact-repository/src/lib.rs`), and falls back to plain
  filesystem discovery for work items, decisions, evidence, and other
  records when there is no `.git`. This is why RepoPact can validate an
  **exported, non-Git tree** at all — it is not a special Android
  accommodation, it is an existing property of the repository model that
  WI060 relies on for its app-private validation fixture.
- WI058 ("User-Centric Tabbed Workbench Information Architecture") designed
  and shipped the compact/adaptive tab primitive, pagination, and IA
  restructuring intended to work down to phone-width viewports, and proved
  it via the desktop WebView2 host resized to mobile/tablet breakpoints. Its
  own closeout evidence (`evidence/runs/20260910-058-adaptive-ia.json`)
  records the platform matrix explicitly: `"android": {"runtime":
  "unexecuted", "build": "unexecuted; adb/Android SDK unavailable"}`. WI058
  did **not** produce Android runtime evidence, and it did not attempt or
  claim to solve Android repository selection — its scope was desktop IA
  only, resized. WI060 does not reopen WI058; it is the first item to
  actually run that IA on an Android runtime.
- Decision 0041 (Tauri desktop uses Rust-owned repository sessions and
  opaque mutation-plan handles) establishes the authority boundary WI060
  must preserve on Android too: the native process owns the
  `RepositorySession`, mutation plans are opaque native-owned handles never
  round-tripped through the frontend, Tauri commands are narrow/typed rather
  than generic filesystem or shell operations, and no plugin/capability is
  granted beyond what a specific operation requires. Decision 0041 does not
  discuss mobile; WI060 must apply the same reasoning to Android rather than
  relax it for mobile convenience.

## What this means for WI060's scope

Android production repository selection is **not solved** by anything that
currently exists in the repository. The correct WI060 posture is:

1. Do not implement a fake/placeholder Android repository-selection path
   that appears to work but silently does something unsafe (broad storage
   permission, hard-coded `/sdcard` path, treating a `content://` URI as a
   filesystem path, or an unrestricted `open_repository(path)` command).
2. Gate `select_repository` by platform: keep the desktop native picker
   exactly as-is, and return an explicit, typed
   `repository.mobile-selection-unavailable` error on a normal Android
   build when no mobile acquisition architecture exists yet.
3. Prove the rest of the Workbench (IA, Back, orientation, safe-area, real
   Rust-backed reads and mutations) against a debug-only, app-private,
   Git-free validation tree — a deliberately narrow bring-up mechanism, not
   a production feature — gated behind a Cargo feature or
   `cfg(all(target_os = "android", debug_assertions))` so it cannot be
   reached from a normal Android production build.
4. If, after real bring-up, the production repository-acquisition boundary
   is still unresolved (the expected outcome, given the facts above), record
   that explicitly and open a follow-up work item (WI061) to design it,
   rather than deciding or implementing that architecture inside WI060.

## Closing boundary decision (recorded, not implemented, by WI060)

Real on-device bring-up confirmed every fact above and did not change any of
them: `select_repository` on Android still returns
`repository.mobile-selection-unavailable` on a normal build; the only path
that opens a repository on Android is the debug-only, feature-gated,
app-private validation mechanism (`android_validation.rs`), which is
unreachable from production authority. No new information surfaced during
bring-up made a production Android repository-selection path possible
without one of: (a) an Android-specific acquisition mechanism (SAF import,
archive import, or a live SAF-backed working tree) that `DesktopService`
does not currently understand, or (b) an embedded Git implementation that
removes the system-`git`-binary assumption `NativeGitRunner` currently makes.

Per AND-016, WI060 does not choose between these — it records that the
boundary remains genuinely unresolved and opens
`work/proposed/061-mobile-repository-acquisition-app-private-workspace-and-git-strategy/`
to decide it. WI060's own scope ends at: the boundary is honestly typed and
enforced (no silent redesign, no fake selection path), and everything on the
Android side of that boundary (IA, Back, orientation, IME, real Rust reads
and a real mutation plan/apply cycle) is proven to work end-to-end against a
tree that already sits inside it.
