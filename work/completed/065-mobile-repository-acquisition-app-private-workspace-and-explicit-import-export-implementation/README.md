# 065 — Mobile Repository Acquisition, App-Private Workspace, and Explicit Import/Export Implementation

> **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Intent

WI061 decided (Decision 0056) that mobile repositories are ordinary
app-private filesystem workspaces, acquired via SAF import, archive import,
or (Stage 2, not this item) an embedded Git backend — never a live
document-provider-backed repository model. This item implements **Stage 1**
of that decision: production SAF directory/document acquisition, safe
recursive directory import, safe archive import, an app-private repository
workspace registry, normal Workbench operation against the resulting
workspace, and explicit export/share-back. It replaces `select_repository`'s
current unconditional `repository.mobile-selection-unavailable` error on a
normal Android build with a real, narrow-authority acquisition flow.

**In scope:** a production mobile workspace registry; SAF
`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`/`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` acquisition; safe bounded
recursive directory import; safe bounded archive import (zip-slip/bomb/
symlink-hardened); the app-private workspace `DesktopService`/
`RepositorySession` open exactly as on desktop; explicit, user-invoked
export/share-back for both import kinds; typed mobile command surface
(import/export only — no clone/pull/push yet); typed progress/cancellation/
error reporting; real Android on-device runtime and security/permission
proof.

**Out of scope:** Stage 2 embedded Git (`git2-rs`/`gix` integration, real
clone/fetch/push, remote credential storage) — that is a further follow-up
this item's own closeout may create or activate; iOS implementation;
changing `RepositoryTopology`, the mutation engine's repository-model
assumptions, or Decision 0041's opaque-plan-handle boundary; any change to
WI050 admission/guard authority.

## Decisions

The governing architectural decision (Decision 0056) already exists.
**Decision 0057** — *Mobile acquisition runtime, workspace registry, and
bounded import/export contract* — settles the implementation-level details
Decision 0056 deliberately left open (workspace root/layout, workspace
identity, registry model, atomicity/recovery, staging-then-publish,
SAF native boundary shape, import/export bounds, duplicate/case-collision
policy, symlink policy, cancellation/progress, export semantics,
divergence-detection honesty requirement, typed error taxonomy, and the
future Git seam), and is binding on this item's implementation.

## Progress

This item is being implemented in checkpoints (see `evidence/runs/` for the
full record of each):

- **Checkpoint A — done.** `rust/crates/repopact-mobile-acquisition/`: the
  workspace registry (atomic temp-file-then-rename JSON, corrupt-registry-
  fails-loudly, no credential fields, stale-temp-file recovery), the bounded
  Rust-owned safe directory importer and safe ZIP importer/exporter (both
  reuse `repopact_repository`'s existing path-containment primitives; both
  enforce entry/byte/depth/path-length bounds during traversal, never
  trusting a source-declared size; both fail closed on exact-duplicate,
  case-only, and file/directory-type path collisions), the operation
  coordinator (single-active-operation, cooperative cancellation, throttled
  progress), and the `WorkspaceManager` orchestration layer implementing
  the staging-then-publish transaction and safe workspace removal. 46
  passing tests, including the adversarial cases (traversal, absolute path,
  duplicate/case/type collisions, resource-limit overflow with a forged
  size hint, cancellation, cleanup, zip-slip, archive symlink rejection,
  malformed ZIP, crash-recovery of orphaned staging). Two real defects this
  work surfaced (a Windows-specific path-canonicalization asymmetry in the
  reused containment primitive, and a ZIP directory-entry trailing-slash
  collision-key gap) are documented and fixed in place, not worked around.
  See `evidence/runs/20260915-065-checkpoint-a-workspace-registry-and-safe-import-export.json`.
- **Checkpoint B — mostly done; one gap recorded honestly.** A real Android
  Tauri mobile plugin, `rust/crates/repopact-mobile-saf/`: Kotlin
  `@TauriPlugin`/`ActivityResult` handling for
  `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`/`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`
  (`SafAcquisitionPlugin.kt`), bridged from Rust via `PluginHandle::
  run_mobile_plugin` into `AndroidSafSource` (implements Checkpoint A's
  `AcquisitionSource` by listing one directory's children per SAF call --
  never a single upfront tree walk) and a staging-file bridge for archive
  documents. The production `MobileAcquisitionCoordinator`
  (`rust/apps/repopact-desktop/src-tauri/src/mobile_acquisition.rs`) wraps
  one `WorkspaceManager` rooted at `app_data_dir()/repositories` (never
  WI060's debug validation path), initialized once in `run()`'s `setup`.
  Seven typed commands (`mobile_workspace_list`, `mobile_import_directory`,
  `mobile_import_archive`, `mobile_operation_status`,
  `mobile_operation_cancel`, `mobile_workspace_open`,
  `mobile_git_capabilities`) are registered only on the Android build;
  `select_repository` and desktop's native picker are completely unchanged.
  A minimal frontend entry surface (`MobileAcquisitionPanel.tsx`: Import
  folder / Import ZIP / existing workspaces / Open) renders only where the
  mobile commands actually exist. A real `npx tauri android build --debug
  --target aarch64 --apk` **succeeded**, producing a genuine debug APK with
  the compiled `SafAcquisitionPlugin.class` linked in; the Android manifest
  permission set is unchanged (no new permission of any kind). The
  interactive on-device/emulator smoke test this checkpoint did not have
  time for was completed in Checkpoint B.5 below. See
  `evidence/runs/20260914-065-checkpoint-b-android-saf-acquisition.json`
  for the full record, including a real build failure (an illegal `--`
  inside an XML comment breaking Android's manifest merger) found and fixed
  by the first real build attempt.
- **Checkpoint B.5 — done, real SAF runtime acceptance.** Booted the
  WI060-proven emulator (`forge_moto_one_hyper_lab_api35`, Android 15/API 35,
  x86_64), built and installed a fresh APK from synchronized source, and
  drove the **real** production app (`android-debug-validation` not used)
  through both real SAF pickers via `adb`/`uiautomator` UI automation --
  never by injecting a URI into native code. Both a small controlled
  directory fixture and a controlled ZIP were imported end-to-end through
  every layer (picker → Kotlin plugin → Rust adapter → `AcquisitionSource` →
  Checkpoint A's bounded importer → staging → app-private workspace →
  registry → frontend list), with **on-device SHA-256 digests matching the
  pre-import fixtures byte-for-byte** for every file. A 400-file real-SAF
  import completed successfully too (408 total files across 3 workspaces),
  strengthening AC-3's real-tree requirement. Both workspaces opened via
  `mobile_workspace_open` and showed real Rust-backed reads (repository
  identity, validation) on the actual production app-private path. Registry
  persistence was proven across two full `force-stop` + relaunch cycles for
  all three workspaces. Picker cancellation (directory and archive, via the
  hardware Back key) was clean: no crash, no error, no phantom workspace.
  The installed package's runtime permission audit showed **zero** granted
  permissions beyond pre-existing `INTERNET`, and a full-session log-privacy
  audit found no `content://` leakage from this app's own log tags.
  Two real defects were found and fixed by this session's own real-build/
  real-run attempts (not fabricated): (1) `listChildren`'s root-level SAF
  call passed a tree URI where `DocumentsContract.getDocumentId` requires a
  document URI, throwing `IllegalArgumentException` on every first
  directory import; (2) that same exception's message (and, independently,
  `Logger.error`'s own throwable-argument stack-trace dump) would have
  logged the full picked-tree `content://` URI unredacted. Both fixed,
  rebuilt, reinstalled, and reverified. **Honest gap:** `mobile_operation_cancel`
  is implemented and host-tested, but `MobileAcquisitionPanel.tsx` exposes no
  UI affordance to trigger it mid-import, so a real runtime
  cancel-while-importing scenario was not executed this session -- recorded
  as a real follow-up rather than faked. See
  `evidence/runs/20260915-065-checkpoint-b5-android-saf-runtime.json`.
- **Checkpoint C — done, production-imported Android workspace mutation
  proof.** Proved that an app-private workspace acquired through the real
  production SAF path behaves identically to a desktop-opened repository
  through the existing, unmodified Rust-owned mutation system. On the same
  WI060/B.5-proven emulator, imported a new, richer SAF-directory fixture
  (a minimal but genuinely valid RepoPact repository -- the B.5 fixture was
  deliberately not one) through the real `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` picker,
  then drove the identical Workbench mutation UI used on desktop end to end:
  Work tab → `001 · Seed work item` → **Edit typed fields** → typed title
  edit → **Review edit plan** (`plan_mutation`) → real review dialog showing
  the opaque plan handle (`plan-1-1`), the Rust-generated diff preview, and
  generated impacts (no MutationPlan DTO serialized into or reconstructed by
  JavaScript) → **Apply approved plan** (`apply_mutation_plan`) → toast
  "Plan applied and post-validation completed." The on-device file hash
  changed exactly as planned (`430c135a…` → `1b0d7f9e…`), the session
  snapshot token was invalidated and replaced (`124440fdaaad…` →
  `52004f1cdd86…`) with no manual refresh, and the session generation
  counter incremented to `2` -- all without an app restart. A full
  force-stop + relaunch cycle then proved the mutation was durably
  persisted (not merely in-memory), and the original external SAF source
  file remained byte-identical throughout, confirming the app-private copy
  was the sole canonical, edited copy per Decision 0056. A cheap secondary
  read-only open of the pre-existing archive-imported workspace confirmed
  the same open/read path works identically for `saf_archive` acquisitions.
  No source change was required anywhere in `DesktopService`,
  `RepositorySession`, `RepositoryTopology`, or the mutation engine --
  Checkpoint C is a pure proof exercise against the already-landed
  production build, and the post-session permission/log-privacy audits
  stayed clean (no new permissions, no crashes, no leaked URIs). The
  optional negative stale-plan test (Section 17) was not attempted this
  session, honestly recorded as not executed rather than faked, since the
  primary AC-5 requirement -- one complete, valid plan/review/apply cycle
  proven through the real UI -- was already fully satisfied. See
  `evidence/runs/20260915-065-checkpoint-c-android-mutation-cycle.json`.
- **Checkpoint D — done, explicit SAF export/share-back and product
  cancellation UX.** Added a platform-neutral `ExportSink`/`ExportFileWriter`
  pair (`repopact-mobile-acquisition::sink`) mirroring `AcquisitionSource`'s
  layering exactly, an `export_tree` walker with the same bounds/path-safety/
  cancellation/progress discipline as import (`export.rs`), and a
  non-cryptographic `SourceStatus` divergence check (`divergence.rs`) that
  compares a fresh, read-only re-listing against the import-time
  `SourceFingerprint`. On Android, a real `AndroidExportSink` stages each
  file locally and uploads it to a SAF destination only in `finish()`,
  exactly mirroring the import-side staging-file pattern; a new export root
  is always created fresh beneath a picked parent (Decision 0057 §6/§7),
  never writing into an arbitrary pre-existing tree, with a typed
  `export_conflict` when a same-named child already exists. Three real
  defects were found and fixed by the first genuine build/on-device
  attempts (not fabricated): a missing `uuid` dependency in
  `repopact-mobile-saf`'s own `Cargo.toml`; the four new `mobile_*` export
  commands being registered in `invoke_handler` but missing from the Tauri
  capability's `commands.allow` list (a real `not allowed` runtime error on
  the first on-device tap); and a cosmetic double-extension
  (`saf-fixture.zip.zip`) in the suggested archive-export filename for a
  workspace whose display name already ended in `.zip`. All three fixed,
  rebuilt, reinstalled, and reverified.

  Real on-device proof: a 400-file directory export (`cancel-fixture`)
  through the real `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` picker, with the app-private
  workspace, the new SAF export, and the original external source all
  hashing identically (`3e32e0bd…`) — full-fidelity, no silent write-back.
  The strongest available proof reused Checkpoint C's mutated workspace: the
  original external source stayed at its original hash (`430c135a…`), the
  app-private workspace stayed at its mutated hash (`1b0d7f9e…`), and the
  freshly exported SAF copy matched the *mutated* hash exactly — all three
  Decision 0056 boundaries proven in one export. Archive export was proven
  for both acquisition kinds: a directory-imported workspace exported as a
  new ZIP (content diffed byte-for-byte against the app-private tree, no
  registry/local-metadata leakage), and the one archive-imported workspace
  (`saf-fixture.zip`) exported as a fresh archive too, closing AC-6's
  "both... acquisition kinds" requirement. A real destination-name conflict
  (re-exporting into an existing export root) surfaced the typed
  `ExportConflict` live, with no silent merge. `MobileAcquisitionPanel.tsx`
  now shows Open/Export folder/Export ZIP/Check source (`saf_directory`
  only)/Remove local copy per workspace, an export-state badge, and — closing
  the real product gap Checkpoint B.5 found — a live progress line and a
  working **Cancel** button whenever any operation is running, verified live
  and tappable during a real 2000-file import. **Honest gap:** despite four
  genuine real-device attempts (two directory exports, two directory
  imports, the largest practical fixture within this session), every
  attempt's own operation completed before this turn-based session's
  screenshot/tap round-trip could land the Cancel tap mid-flight — a
  limitation of this testing methodology's latency, not of the Cancel
  mechanism itself, which is independently proven at the host-test level and
  was directly observed live and tappable. No source change was needed
  anywhere in `DesktopService`, `RepositorySession`, `RepositoryTopology`,
  or the mutation engine. Post-session permission and log-privacy audits
  stayed clean. An unrelated host-emulator (qemu) crash and restart occurred
  mid-session; all workspaces survived except the mutation-carrying one
  (lost at the emulator's own storage layer, not through any RepoPact code
  path) — its export proof above was already captured and recorded before
  the crash. See
  `evidence/runs/20260915-065-checkpoint-d-android-export-shareback.json`.
- **Checkpoint E (final assurance, Stage-2 Git follow-up, and closeout) —
  done.** Re-synchronized against `origin/main` (both at `d5c4e23`, no
  divergence to reconcile) and re-read decisions 0041/0056/0057, WI061's
  closeout, and all four prior checkpoint evidence records to confirm the
  implementation still matches those decisions after the concurrent WI050,
  WI066/3.1.0, and WI022 merges. Confirmed AC-9's seam half structurally,
  not just in prose: `AcquisitionKind::RemoteGit` and
  `GitState::EmbeddedGitManaged` already exist as reserved enum variants in
  `registry.rs`, `mobile_git_capabilities` already returns a typed
  `Stage2Status::UnsupportedStage2` capability descriptor, and
  `DesktopService`/`RepositorySession`/`RepositoryTopology`/the mutation
  pipeline remain untouched — all without forcing the existing
  shell-shaped `GitRunner` trait to become the future `GitBackend`
  abstraction, which correctly does not yet exist in code. Allocated the
  Stage-2 follow-up canonically via `repopact new work-item` (after
  rebuilding the release `repopact-engine` binary, made stale by the
  concurrent 3.1.0 version cut) as **WI068 — Embedded Mobile Git Backend
  and Remote Repository Synchronization** (`proposed`, depends on 065,
  cross-references decisions 0056/0057 and WI067 without a hard dependency
  on WI067). Re-audited the WI066→WI067 renumbering: intact, no stale
  current-canonical reference found; the one remaining "WI066" mention
  (inside Checkpoint D's evidence) is accurate historical narration of the
  rename and was left unmodified. Re-inventoried the 11-command mobile
  surface, Android manifest permissions, and privacy/logging discipline —
  all unchanged and still clean since Checkpoint D. Left the cancellation
  honest-gap and `android_validation.rs`'s debug-only disposition as
  Checkpoint D recorded them (neither is reopened; deletion of
  `android_validation.rs` is not required and was not performed). Ran the
  full final validation suite on synchronized main: `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo check --workspace`, and `cargo test --workspace` (all green, zero
  failures across every crate including 67 `repopact-mobile-acquisition`
  tests), frontend `typecheck`/`vitest` (29/29)/`build` (all green), and
  `repopact validate --root .` (clean). No Android rebuild was needed since
  no Android source or build input changed after Checkpoint D. See
  `evidence/runs/20260915-065-final-closeout.json`.

AC-1 through AC-9 are all `satisfied` in `work-item.json`. This work item
is now `completed`.

## Scope

- `rust/apps/repopact-desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (`select_repository` and
  new import/export commands)
- a new mobile-acquisition module/crate (workspace registry, safe import,
  safe extraction)
- `rust/apps/repopact-desktop/src-tauri/gen/android/` (SAF-related
  Kotlin/plugin glue if Tauri's own plugins do not cover
  `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`/`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`)
- `rust/apps/repopact-desktop/src-tauri/capabilities/`,
  `permissions/` (narrow additions only — no generic fs/shell)
- frontend workspace-selection/import/export UI
- `evidence/runs/` (Android on-device import/export/mutation/export-back
  proof)

## Closeout

All nine acceptance criteria are satisfied by linked evidence (see
`work-item.json`). The Stage-2 follow-up, **WI068 — Embedded Mobile Git
Backend and Remote Repository Synchronization**, was created (`proposed`,
not activated) at this item's own closeout per AC-9 and Decision 0056. This
directory has moved to `work/completed/`.
