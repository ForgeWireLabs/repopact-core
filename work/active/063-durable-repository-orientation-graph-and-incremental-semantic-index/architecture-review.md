## 2026-09-13 activation refresh

**Refreshed baseline:** `8642b91c09fa0bfbbf72375f23bafee6fdf8cf45`  
**Coding agent:** Claude Code  
**Architecture reviewer:** GPT-5.6 Sol, High reasoning (operator-relayed refresh)  
**Status:** activation gate satisfied; WI063 moved `proposed` -> `active`

This section supplements the original 2026-09-12 review above. The original
review's analysis, recommendations, and risk table are not rewritten; they
remain accurate as architecture guidance. This section records what changed
between the reviewed base and activation, and what does not need to change.

### Activation gate

The original review's Activation recommendation held WI063 `proposed` until
"the release-parity UI work and public-release hardening reach the agreed
release gate." That gate is now crossed:

- WI055 (Tauri Workbench foundation) — completed.
- WI058 (tabbed/responsive IA) — completed.
- WI060 (Android Workbench runtime bring-up) — completed.
- WI062 (cross-platform installation/launcher validation) — completed.
- WI046 (local-first verification/release architecture) — completed, with a
  genuine passing Linux CI proof and a real, reproducible host release
  build (evidence: `evidence/runs/20260913-046-final-closeout.json`).
- WI064 (research metadata consistency repair) — completed.

No release-destabilizing work remains queued ahead of WI063 per the
`work/active` and `work/proposed` lifecycle state at the refreshed baseline.

### What changed in the Rust core since the reviewed base (`98c2aa8`)

The reviewed base already reflected `repopact-graph`/`repopact-repository`/
the engine protocol accurately for WI063's purposes. Between `98c2aa8` and
`8642b91`, the commits that touched adjacent architecture were:

- **WI046** (`9d4c508`, `017f73f`, `bbcb023`, and the WI050/WI057 portability
  fixes `74b00e0`/`37dad3e`/`267b80e`): added `CoverageSummary.host_ready`
  to `repopact/verification.py`, a `repopact_release.aggregate_release_readiness`
  operation, and a new `repopact verify status` local-only status view. None
  of this touches `repopact-graph`, `repopact-repository`'s session/snapshot
  model, or the engine protocol's operation dispatch shape. The engine
  protocol's `EngineRequest`/`EngineResponse` envelope and one-shot-per-process
  dispatch model (Decision 0042) are unchanged and remain the correct seam
  for new `graph.*` operations.
- A real, previously-latent **POSIX process-containment gap** was found and
  fixed in `rust/crates/repopact-repository/src/git.rs` (commit `37dad3e`):
  `contain_child()` on non-Windows was a no-op, so `NativeGitRunner`'s
  timeout path could leave an orphaned grandchild process running past its
  configured timeout under process models where a shell does not exec
  directly into its target command. This is now fixed with POSIX
  process-group containment (`process_group(0)` + `killpg` via
  `libc::kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`). This is directly relevant to WI063: any new
  Git invocation added for graph-orientation purposes inherits this fixed,
  bounded-timeout behavior automatically through `NativeGitRunner`, and the
  WI057 git-invocation-count regression test
  (`snapshot_git_invocation_count_is_bounded_independent_of_work_items`,
  bound `<= 4` invocations per `RepositorySession::snapshot()`) must
  continue to pass unmodified.
- A **cross-platform release-build reproducibility gap** was found and fixed
  in `repopact/release_build.py` (commit `267b80e`): the release build's
  anti-nondeterminism `RUSTFLAGS` (`-C debuginfo=0`, path remapping) were
  previously Windows-only. This is orthogonal to WI063's own durable-graph
  determinism requirement (ROG-011) but is worth noting as a precedent: the
  same class of "ephemeral build/export path leaking into a supposedly
  deterministic output" defect is exactly what WI063's canonical
  serialization rule (no host absolute paths, no nondeterministic
  timestamps) must guard against from the start, not discover after the
  fact.
- **WI054's `repopact-graph` crate** (`rust/crates/repopact-graph/src/lib.rs`,
  511 lines, single file) is unchanged in shape from what the original
  review describes: a flat `GraphNodeKind`/`GraphEdgeKind` enum pair, no
  "layer" concept, `RepositoryGraph::build(&RepositorySnapshot)` walking
  `RecordIndex` sections into nodes/edges, deterministic `sort()`/`dedup()`
  on edges. The original review's recommendation to extend this crate with
  a "second, derived repository-orientation domain" rather than replace it
  is directly actionable as written.
- **No `.repopact` transaction database, daemon, or hidden journal** has
  been introduced anywhere between the reviewed base and the refreshed
  baseline (confirmed via WI054's closeout evidence, which explicitly
  records "no persistent repository-local transaction DB / hidden journal /
  daemon state permitted" as GAM-018, unchanged and unaffected by any
  subsequent work item).
- **`repopact-mutation`'s plan/apply boundary** (Decision 0040) is
  unchanged. It has no atomic-write (tempfile+rename) primitive of its own;
  durability instead comes from content-addressed stale-plan detection,
  preimage capture before any write, and a mandatory post-write
  `repopact_validation::validate()` gate. WI063's foundation phase
  implements its own self-contained atomic durable-graph write (build to a
  fresh temporary directory, verify, then swap into place) rather than
  forcing graph regeneration through `MutationRequest`/`MutationPlan`: a
  full-graph rebuild is a "recompute a deterministic projection from
  filtered source, write derived output" operation, not a targeted
  governance-record edit with a small content-addressed read set, and the
  fit with WI054's typed mutation surface (scoped to work-item
  create/edit/lifecycle/dependency/AC operations, GAM-008/009) is poor. This
  foundation phase's atomic-write behavior is documented in Decision 0044
  rather than silently diverging from WI054's safety properties.

### Stale proposal assumptions to correct

- The proposal's rollout-plan Phase 0 line "refresh this architecture
  review if the Rust core changed materially since WI063 creation" is
  satisfied by this section; the Rust core did not change materially for
  WI063's purposes (see above), so implementation proceeds from the
  original review's recommendations without further architectural
  reconsideration.
### Consolidated implementation sequence for this session

One plan across the layers named in the activation brief, with explicit
phase boundaries. This session (the foundation checkpoint) implements
phases 1-4, 9 (protocol/CLI only, no semantic operations), and 13-partial
(structural validation only). It does not implement phases 5-8, 10-12, or
14.

1. **Durable graph contract** — Decision 0044 (this session).
2. **Graph core** — `GraphLayer`/`DerivationClass` typed vocabulary, new
   physical `GraphNodeKind`/`GraphEdgeKind` variants added to the existing
   `repopact-graph` crate (this session).
3. **Repository/session integration** — physical graph built from
   `RepositorySession`/`RepositorySnapshot`/`Repository::all_files()`; no
   second crawler (this session).
4. **Durable serialization** — manifest + stable-sharded JSONL writer/reader
   with atomic swap-in (this session).
5. **Source projection/fingerprint** — `SourceProjection` module, SHA-256
   content-digest based, self-exclusion, additive to shared
   `IGNORED_PARTS` (this session).
6. **Freshness** — typed `fresh/partial/stale/unsupported/corrupt/absent`
   status derived by recomputing the projection fingerprint against the
   manifest (this session; `working_overlay` is declared in the enum but
   never emitted this session — no watcher/dirty-tree integration yet).
7. **Incremental updates** — NOT this session. Full-build determinism is
   the oracle this phase establishes; incremental update requires that
   oracle to already be stable (per the proposal's own rollout order).
8. **Semantic adapters** — NOT this session. No Tree-sitter, no
   symbol/call graph. Only physical topology (directory/file/workspace/
   config/nested-repository) this session.
9. **Build/test/operational adapters** — NOT this session beyond the
   minimal, already-deterministic manifest-presence classification
   (`Workspace`/`ConfigurationFile` nodes for a directory containing
   `Cargo.toml`/`pyproject.toml`/`package.json`); no Cargo-metadata/
   pyproject/package.json *parsing* or dependency-edge extraction.
10. **Engine protocol/CLI** — `graph.status`/`graph.build`/`graph.verify`
    engine operations and `repopact graph status|build|verify` CLI (this
    session). No `context`/`impact`/`tests`/`governance`/`orient` query
    operations yet beyond a bounded `graph.status` summary.
11. **Adoption/backfill** — NOT this session. `repopact adopt` is
    unmodified. Backfill is the explicit, already-implemented
    `repopact graph build` command; no `adopt`/`doctor` integration.
12. **Workbench** — NOT this session. No new Tauri command, no new frontend
    view. The existing `relationship_graph`/`GraphView` surface is
    unmodified and continues to serve the flat governance graph exactly as
    before (physical-layer nodes/edges are additive to the same
    `RepositoryGraph`, so `GraphView` will begin including them once the
    physical builder runs, but no UI is added to filter/present them
    differently this session).
13. **Validation/conformance** — structural durable-graph validation
    (manifest/shard integrity, duplicate IDs, dangling edges, canonical
    ordering, path safety, fingerprint match) integrated into the Rust
    validation path this session. Incremental/full equivalence,
    clean-clone timing, symlink/adversarial fuzzing, and cross-language
    coverage-matrix validation are NOT this session.
14. **Benchmarking/research** — NOT this session. No S8 R1 amendment, no
    R1 run, no performance/scale evidence beyond what falls out of the
    correctness tests above.

### Fingerprint primitive at the refreshed baseline

The original review's observation that no git blob-hash/content-identity
API exists is still true at the refreshed baseline (confirmed by direct code
  inspection: `git.rs`'s `NativeGitRunner`/`GitRunner` trait exposes only a
  generic bounded `run(root, args, label)`, and the only git queries
  actually issued by `RepositoryTopology::build` remain
  `rev-parse --git-common-dir`, `worktree list --porcelain`,
  `ls-files --cached`, and one bounded `log` call for evidence-run
  commits). Decision 0044 therefore fixes the source-projection fingerprint
  on the existing SHA-256 content-digest primitive
  (`Repository::path_state`) rather than git blob identity, to avoid adding
  per-file git invocations that would violate the WI057 bounded-invocation
  guarantee. This is recorded as a decision, not an oversight; a future
  bounded git blob-identity API (e.g. one `git ls-tree -r` call folded into
  `RepositoryTopology::build`) remains open for a later phase if profiling
  justifies it.

## Executive conclusion

RepoPact already has the right foundation for a durable repository-orientation system, but the existing WI054 graph is intentionally limited to RepoPact governance relationships. WI063 should extend the canonical Rust graph/query stack with a second, derived repository-orientation domain rather than create a new service, external database, or model-specific memory layer.

The recommended architecture is:

                agent        CLI       Workbench    automation
```

The durable graph is a materialized projection, not a source of truth. The core correctness rule should be that a clean full rebuild and a supported incremental update converge to the same canonical graph for the same repository state.

## Current architecture facts

### 1. WI054 already owns the canonical governance relationship graph

`rust/crates/repopact-graph/src/lib.rs` currently defines a deterministic `RepositoryGraph` over the `RepositorySnapshot` and models governance-oriented node types including:

- repository;
- work item;
- acceptance criterion;
- evidence run;
- scope;
- role;
- decision;
- policy;
- contract;
- invariant;
- frozen surface;
- audit finding.

Its current edge types include relationships such as dependency/reverse dependency, containment, evidence support, ownership, affected scopes, supersession, concern, constraints, intersections, applicability, and role allowance.

This graph is source-backed and explicitly avoids promoting arbitrary text mentions into authoritative edges. That principle should be preserved.

### 2. WI054 already established the correct read model

WI054 introduced `RepositorySession` plus immutable snapshot/index semantics so validation, graph, analysis, and mutation planning do not each crawl the filesystem independently.

WI063 should consume that same snapshot model. It should not create a second repository crawler that races the canonical session or disagrees about ignored paths, linked worktrees, record-relative references, or repository identity.

### 3. WI056 made the Rust core canonical for proven semantic surfaces

Decision 0042 and WI056 establish one semantic engine rather than permanent Rust/Python dual authority. Python is a compatibility client for migrated surfaces. The Workbench calls the Rust crates directly.

The ROG therefore belongs in the canonical Rust engine and language-neutral protocol. Reimplementing repository orientation in Python or TypeScript would recreate the semantic split WI056 just removed.

### 4. The Workbench is already a real graph consumer

The Tauri 2 Workbench is a thin user-facing client over the Rust repository model and graph/analysis surfaces. WI058 also established that the UI must remain usable on wide and compact form factors and cannot depend on hover or right-click for essential behavior.

The new graph should therefore expose useful typed query projections rather than make the UI calculate semantic relationships itself.

### 5. There is currently no authorized persistent repository-local runtime database

WI054 explicitly rejected introducing a persistent `.repopact` transaction database, daemon, or hidden journal as an implementation detail without a separate durable architecture decision.

WI063 is the appropriate separate architecture work item to decide a *derived graph representation*, but the distinction matters. A durable graph index is not a transaction journal. Its representation must remain reconstructable from authoritative repository state.

### 6. Research metrics are now registered before graph implementation

H15/S8 governance-continuity work has already registered orientation-cost measures including tool calls, file reads, bytes read, and repository-wide grep/search operations. The benchmark protocol explicitly preserves B0 and R0 and permits a future graph-enabled condition only through a new dated amendment before graph runs.

That gives WI063 an unusually clean evaluation opportunity. The graph can be tested against metrics chosen before implementation.

## Problem decomposition

The orientation problem has four distinct parts and they should not be collapsed into one undifferentiated graph.

### A. Physical topology

The system needs a cheap, deterministic map of repository structure: files, directories, packages, workspaces, modules, configs, generated boundaries, nested repositories, and key entry points.

This layer should be available even when no rich language parser exists.

### B. Code semantics

Language adapters should add definitions, imports, exports, type/implementation relations, selected references or calls, and test symbols where those relations can be extracted with known quality.

The system should never claim whole-program semantic completeness merely because syntax parsing succeeded.

### C. Build/test/operational topology

Package manifests, Cargo metadata, pyproject metadata, package.json/tsconfig, CI workflows, build scripts, installers, runtime entry points, and test structure often answer orientation questions better than raw source parsing alone.

This should be a first-class layer, not an afterthought.

### D. Governance overlay

The existing WI054 graph should connect to source/topology nodes so an agent can ask what scope, contract, invariant, frozen rule, work item, decision, evidence, or finding applies to a code region.

This is where RepoPact has a unique advantage over ordinary code indexes.

## Recommended state model

Use three distinct states:

```text
Gc = durable committed graph baseline
Dw = local dirty working-tree overlay
Q  = optional disposable query acceleration index
```

The effective working graph is conceptually:

```text
Gw = apply(Gc, Dw)
```

`Q` may index `Gc` or `Gw` for performance, but it is never authority.

This separation avoids two bad designs:

1. committing a binary database that rewrites constantly and merges poorly;
2. keeping the useful graph only in a local cache, which would destroy clean-clone continuity.

## Durable representation recommendation

The exact path and schema should be fixed in a recorded decision, but the preferred class of format is:

```text
manifest.json
nodes/<stable-shard>.jsonl
edges/<stable-shard>.jsonl
```

with canonical sorting and stable partitioning.

Reasons:

- text-friendly and inspectable;
- deterministic rebuild is testable;
- content hashes can detect corruption;
- shards reduce merge/diff churn;
- local SQLite can be rebuilt from it;
- alternate implementations can consume the format;
- Git can replicate it with the repository.

A single huge JSON file would be simple but would create unnecessary rewrite and merge churn on large repositories. A committed SQLite file would query well but would be poor as the only reviewable, mergeable, deterministic source representation.

## Source fingerprint recommendation

Do not bind the graph to the raw Git tree hash because the graph files themselves would contribute to that tree and create a circular dependency.

Define a canonical source projection `P(repo)` that excludes:

- durable ROG output itself;
- local caches;
- `.git` internals;
- explicitly ignored/generated/vendor areas according to policy;
- any other derived artifact intentionally excluded from graph input.

Then compute a deterministic fingerprint over sorted repository-relative input identities, preferably Git blob IDs where available and content hashes otherwise.

This allows a clean clone to verify that the committed graph corresponds to the committed source projection without rereading all source bytes.

## Freshness model recommendation

Graph queries should return a freshness state with their data.

A useful initial state machine is:

```text
fresh
working_overlay
partial
stale
unsupported
corrupt
```

`partial` and `stale` are deliberately different. Partial means the graph truthfully lacks coverage for some regions or relation classes. Stale means previously covered source changed without a corresponding graph update.

A client must not convert either state into an implicit clean success.

## Incremental update invariant

The most important implementation invariant is:

```text
canonicalize(incremental_update(G0, delta))
    ==
canonicalize(full_build(source_after_delta))
```

This should be tested across representative change classes.

Git diff/blob identity can drive committed-state invalidation. The existing Workbench watcher can drive dirty working-tree invalidation. Parser-specific dependency information can narrow the recomputation neighborhood further.

Do not optimize incremental behavior until the full-build canonical form is stable enough to serve as the oracle.

## Parser recommendation

Tree-sitter is the best default candidate for broad syntax coverage and incremental parsing, but it should be treated as an implementation choice to validate, not a dogma.

Use the cheapest deterministic source that can accurately establish a relationship:

- filesystem/Git for topology;
- Cargo metadata for crate/workspace/dependency facts;
- pyproject/package metadata for Python packaging;
- package.json/tsconfig/workspaces for JS/TS package structure;
- CI/build manifests for operational topology;
- Tree-sitter or language-specific parsers for symbols/imports and selected references;
- specialized language tooling only when the fidelity gain justifies packaging and runtime cost.

The normalized graph schema should hide adapter-specific implementation details from clients.

## Provenance recommendation

Do not use a single vague `confidence` field for everything.

Prefer an explicit derivation/provenance class with optional confidence only for relations that are genuinely heuristic.

Examples:

```text
canonical_record
filesystem
manifest
parser
build_metadata
heuristic
inferred
```

Where RepoPact's existing provenance vocabulary is semantically appropriate, reuse it instead of inventing a conflicting certainty system. The final decision should specify the mapping.

Every edge should be able to point back to the source fact that produced it.

## Agent API recommendation

The graph should be designed around orientation questions, not visualization.

Minimum semantic operations:

```text
status
resolve
context/orient
neighbors
path
dependencies
dependents
impact
tests
governance
```

A bounded `orient(target)` response is especially important. It should return a small high-value neighborhood and source-backed reading list rather than dumping thousands of graph edges into the context window.

The output should support depth, edge filters, pagination/cursors, and output size/token limits.

## Workbench recommendation

Reuse the existing Graph section and typed Rust DTO pattern.

Do not make a force-directed canvas a blocker. For actual repository work, filtered tables, trees, lists, relationship groups, impact panels, test panels, governance overlays, and source navigation are likely more useful and accessible.

The UI must surface graph freshness and coverage prominently enough that the operator knows when an answer is partial or stale.

## Adoption recommendation

Build the initial graph during `repopact adopt` after governance records have been reconstructed, because that is the moment RepoPact is already paying repository-discovery cost and can immediately connect topology to governance.

However, graph capability should remain versioned and explicitly disableable. A repository with unsupported languages or policy constraints should not become invalid merely because it cannot or does not want to persist the optional graph capability.

Existing adopters should receive an explicit backfill operation rather than a hidden large write during an unrelated `doctor` command unless a later decision deliberately makes graph creation part of doctor migration.

## Privacy and security recommendation

The durable graph should store metadata, not source duplication.

Default exclusions should cover build outputs, package caches, virtual environments, node_modules/target-like trees, ignored secret files, binaries, and external symlink targets.

Parser and graph builders must treat the repository as hostile input. Tests should include malformed syntax, giant files, symlink escape attempts, malicious graph files, extreme graph fan-out, and corrupted shards.

No external service is required for core graph generation.

## Merge and version-control recommendation

A graph conflict is a derived-artifact conflict. Source merge resolution wins.

Provide deterministic regeneration so developers do not need to manually reason about JSONL edge conflicts. Stable sharding should keep unrelated changes from touching the same files whenever practical.

If the durable graph is stale after a merge, validation/status should say so directly and provide the canonical repair command.

## Backward compatibility recommendation

Do not make the existence of ROG mandatory for every RepoPact 3.x repository.

Use an explicit capability contract:

```text
ROG disabled/absent -> repository can remain valid
ROG declared enabled -> graph manifest/freshness/validation is binding
```

A later major/versioned decision may change defaults for newly adopted repositories after migration behavior is proven.

## Evaluation recommendation

Preserve the already-registered S8 B0 and R0 conditions. Before graph-enabled runs, add R1 by dated amendment.

The most informative R1 outputs are likely:

- governance recovery precision/recall;
- seeded violation recall;
- false-clean rate;
- orientation time;
- tool calls;
- file reads;
- broad grep/search operations;
- bytes read;
- input tokens;
- human intervention.

The graph should count as useful only if it reduces orientation cost without lowering correctness.

## Primary risks

| Risk | Failure mode | Required mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stale graph | agent trusts obsolete structure | source fingerprint, explicit freshness, fail-visible queries |
| graph bloat | large diffs/storage cost | exclusions, stable sharding, coverage tiers, benchmarks |
| false semantic precision | syntax edge presented as whole-program truth | per-relation coverage and provenance |
| duplicate authority | graph conflicts with RepoPact records | governance overlay reuses WI054 sources, graph cannot grant authority |
| merge churn | derived shards conflict constantly | deterministic rebuild, stable partitioning |
| parser attack | malformed repo consumes memory/time | bounded adapters, cancellation, failure isolation |
| privacy leak | graph captures secrets or source bodies | metadata-only core, ignore/exclusion policy |
| client divergence | UI/CLI/agent compute different relationships | one canonical Rust graph/query engine |
| hidden local dependency | graph only works on original machine | durable portable representation and clean-clone tests |
| premature benchmark tuning | metrics chosen after implementation | S8 metrics already registered, R1 amendment before runs |

## What must not happen during implementation

- Do not add a second Python or TypeScript semantic graph engine.
- Do not make an LLM-generated summary the durable graph.
- Do not commit a local cache database and call it the canonical format without a new decision.
- Do not let parser output grant governance authority.
- Do not hide unsupported regions.
- Do not make graph freshness a UI-only concern.
- Do not require broad repository grep as the graph query implementation.
- Do not destabilize RepoPact's imminent public-release path merely to land this feature early.

## Activation recommendation

Keep WI063 proposed until the release-parity UI work and public-release hardening reach the agreed release gate.

When activated, refresh this review against the then-current Rust core, name the coding agent, and produce one implementation plan across the graph crate, repository/session model, protocol, adoption, Workbench, validation, docs, and research boundary before coding begins.

## Final architecture judgment

The concept is a strong fit for RepoPact because it extends the same portability idea from governance state to repository orientation while keeping the repository itself as the rendezvous point.

The architecture is viable if three boundaries remain strict:

1. the graph is derived and freshness-aware, never sovereign;
2. one canonical Rust graph/query engine serves all clients;
3. durable graph usefulness is measured against pre-registered clean-clone orientation metrics rather than asserted from intuition.

Under those constraints, WI063 can turn RepoPact from a system that tells a worker *what is governed* into one that can also tell the worker *where to look and what the surrounding change surface is*, without making every new agent rediscover the repository by brute force.

## 2026-09-13 semantic-phase refresh

**Refreshed baseline:** `c8c56739bfbe355d4a8a382eebe36aef550fa6b4`
**Coding agent:** Claude Code
**Architecture reviewer:** GPT-5.6 Sol, High reasoning (operator-relayed refresh)
**Status:** foundation checkpoint accepted as the durable oracle; semantic-adapter checkpoint begins

This section supplements the foundation checkpoint above and its own
2026-09-13 activation refresh; neither is rewritten. It records what
changes for the semantic phase and a schema-compatibility issue that must
be fixed before any semantic node/edge kind is added.

### Foundation accepted as oracle

The durable physical graph proven at `c8c5673` (schema v1: `Repository`,
`Directory`, `File`, `Workspace`, `ConfigurationFile`, `NestedRepository`
nodes; `Contains`/`BelongsToWorkspace`/`ConfiguredBy`/`Intersects` edges;
cross-platform byte-identical rebuild proven on native Windows and
Linux-native WSL2 Debian 13) is accepted as-is. This phase does not modify
its node/edge semantics, its exclusion policy, its sharding rule, or its
build-then-swap write path. Semantic extraction is additive.

### The schema-evolution issue (must be fixed before adding node/edge kinds)

Decision 0044 section 4 requires same-major schema evolution to remain
readable by an implementation supporting that major. `GraphNodeKind` and
`GraphEdgeKind` are closed Rust enums with `#[serde(rename_all =
"snake_case")]` and no catch-all/unknown variant. `serde_json`
deserializes a closed enum by exact string match against its variants; an
unrecognized variant string is a **hard deserialization error**, not a
silently-ignored unknown value. If a `Symbol` node kind or a `Defines`
edge kind were added directly to these enums and the manifest's
`graph_schema_version` were left at `1`, an older binary that still only
knows the v1 variant set would fail to parse the shard JSONL lines
containing the new variants -- exactly the "an older v1 reader rejects a
supposedly v1 graph" defect this phase must avoid. This is confirmed by a
focused compatibility test (`durable::tests::v1_reader_rejects_a_shard_containing_an_unrecognized_node_kind_string`)
added before any semantic implementation, proving the failure mode
directly rather than reasoning about it abstractly.

The fix is **not** to make the enums open/stringly-typed (that would
defeat the purpose of a typed vocabulary) and **not** to keep semantic
content at schema version 1 (that would misrepresent the compatibility
contract). The fix is to bump `graph_schema_version` to `2` for any
durable graph containing semantic content, and to make the reader
explicitly branch on major version: a v1 reader path that only ever
constructs v1-legal enum values, and a v2 reader path that understands the
extended vocabulary. `repopact graph build` always writes the newest
version the running binary supports; `repopact graph verify`/`status`
reject an unknown major (already true since the foundation checkpoint) and
correctly read either 1 or 2 for what they are. See Decision 0045 for the
binding contract.

### Semantic scope for this checkpoint

Deterministic Rust, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript/JSX/TSX symbol and
import extraction via Tree-sitter (evaluated and selected below), landing
as `GraphLayer::Semantic` nodes/edges with `DerivationClass::Parser`. No
incremental update, no query surface beyond `graph.status`/`build`/
`verify` reporting semantic coverage, no Workbench UI, no `adopt`
integration, no S8 R1. See Decision 0045 and
`implementation-progress.md`'s semantic-checkpoint section for exact
scope boundaries.

### Parser substrate evaluation

Tree-sitter was evaluated against language-specific stacks (Rust `syn`,
Python's own `ast`/a Rust Python parser, SWC/Oxc-style JS/TS parsers) on:
one common adapter architecture (Tree-sitter: yes, via a single `Parser` +
per-language grammar crate, uniform `Node`/`Tree` API across all four
languages -- language-specific stacks would require four structurally
different parser APIs and four different AST shapes to normalize, a
materially larger adapter-architecture cost for this checkpoint's
language count); determinism (both classes are deterministic for
well-formed input; Tree-sitter's error-recovery grammar additionally
gives deterministic partial output for malformed input, which `syn` and
strict language parsers typically reject outright); incremental
capability (Tree-sitter has first-class incremental re-parse via
`Tree::edit` + old-tree reuse, directly usable by a future incremental
phase; most language-specific parsers do not); malformed-input behavior
(Tree-sitter produces a partial tree with explicit `ERROR`/`is_missing`
nodes rather than aborting, which is exactly the "coverage gap, not a
crash" behavior ROG-022 requires); cancellation/resource bounding
(Tree-sitter 0.27's `parse_with_options` + progress-callback + `reset()`
API, spiked and proven below); Windows/Linux portability (Tree-sitter
grammar crates are portable C compiled via `cc`, proven by a real spike
compiling all five grammars on this Windows machine; both platforms
already build the existing Rust workspace's native code identically);
Rust/native packaging cost (grammar crates are small, self-contained C
sources with no external system library dependency -- no `libclang`, no
system Tree-sitter install required, matching the "released engine must
carry the deterministic parser capability locally" requirement); license
(Tree-sitter core and all four evaluated grammars are MIT-licensed,
compatible with RepoPact's existing dependency posture); maintenance
activity (Tree-sitter core and all four grammar crates have current
releases on crates.io as of this session). Fashion was not a factor in the
decision; the concrete criteria above were.

**Verdict:** Tree-sitter selected, with the version pin, MSRV finding, and
spike results recorded in Decision 0045 and
`implementation-progress.md`.

## 2026-09-13 incremental-equivalence refresh

- **Actual starting SHA for this phase:**
  `2b8e193985837691a7cca1d4d63050038c715a08` (WI037
  reconciliation on top of the prior WI022 evidence commits; no WI063 file
  was touched between the semantic-adapter checkpoint's push and this
  phase starting).
- **Semantic-adapter checkpoint accepted as oracle.** Everything Decision
  0045 bound (Tree-sitter selection, schema v2, adapter API, symbol/
  relation taxonomy, resource/cancellation policy) is treated as settled
  and load-bearing for this phase; nothing in that checkpoint is
  reopened, and no new semantic scope (exports/public detection, JS
  test-framework recognition, resolved imports, call graph, `implements`/
  `extends`/`uses_type`) is added here.
- **The full semantic build remains the correctness oracle.** This phase
  adds `graph.update` as an optimization on top of
  `RepositoryGraph::build_with_fingerprint`, never a second, independently
  trusted extraction path -- see Decision 0046 section 1.
- **Watcher/dirty overlay remains deferred.** ROG-013 and
  `Freshness::WorkingOverlay` are untouched; `graph.update` operates on an
  explicit `RepositorySnapshot`, exactly like `graph.build`, with no
  filesystem-watcher integration and no per-keystroke durable write.
- **Incremental work begins only now,** scoped exactly to ROG-012: prove
  `canonical(G_incremental(s0->s1)) == canonical(G_full(s1))` for every
  required change class, using the architecture bound in Decision 0046
  (governance + physical rebuilt globally every call; only semantic
  extraction is contribution-incremental, via one shared per-file
  contribution primitive consumed by both the full build and the
  incremental path).

See Decision 0046 and `implementation-progress.md`'s
incremental-equivalence-checkpoint section for the full architecture,
test matrix, and evidence.

## 2026-09-13 working-overlay refresh

- **Actual starting SHA for this phase:**
  `d7687c6871d162b4c37b35e666c157ac9af4ca8e` (the accepted
  incremental-equivalence checkpoint).
- **ROG-012 accepted.** The full semantic build remains the correctness
  oracle; nothing in the incremental-equivalence checkpoint is reopened.
- **Durable incremental update remains explicit/operator-driven.** Only
  `repopact graph update` (or `graph.build`) writes `rog/`; nothing added
  in this phase changes that.
- **The working-tree overlay is session-local and non-durable.** It lives
  in an in-memory `SessionGraphState` (`repopact-graph::overlay`), never
  serialized to disk, never a repository-local database, and disappears
  when the owning session/process ends.
- **The durable graph remains the committed baseline.** A session's
  effective graph may diverge from it (working-tree edits not yet
  written), but `rog/` itself is never touched by ordinary watcher/session
  activity -- proven by a dedicated byte-identical-shards test across a
  burst of overlay operations.
- **Watcher events are invalidation/update hints, not graph authority.**
  A watcher-reported path is re-stat/re-hashed before anything is
  trusted; a duplicate or already-current event produces no change; a
  directory-shaped or oversized burst falls back to a full in-memory
  reconcile rather than being trusted at face value (Decision 0047).
- **Query/client results must disclose when overlay state contributes.**
  `EffectiveGraphStatus` (basis / durable freshness / coverage /
  fingerprints / changed-path count / overlay generation) is the typed
  surface a session-aware client reads instead of silently treating the
  effective graph as "the durable map."

The eliminated behavior this phase specifically targets: the pre-existing
desktop watcher/session flow called `core.graph_snapshot(snapshot)` (a
full governance+physical+semantic rebuild from scratch) on every
watcher-debounced event, every explicit refresh, and every mutation
apply. Once semantic adapters existed (the prior checkpoint), this meant
a full source-projection content-hash walk plus full semantic reparse on
ordinary interactive file edits. This phase replaces that with a
targeted, in-memory reconciliation keyed off the watcher's own
already-known changed paths, reusing Decision 0046's contribution
primitive (`semantic::build_file_contribution`) and delta-reconciliation
machinery (`incremental::plan_reconciliation`, now shared rather than
duplicated) instead of a second implementation.

See Decision 0047 and `implementation-progress.md`'s
working-overlay-checkpoint section for the full architecture, test
matrix, and evidence.

## 2026-09-14 metadata and operational topology refresh

- **Actual starting SHA:** `dfd56903c5cd9298059527f1dbd98515cbd5ce32`
  (the accepted working-overlay checkpoint).
- **Coding agent:** Claude Code. **Architecture reviewer:** GPT-5.6 Sol
  High.
- **Durable/incremental/overlay layers accepted as-is.** Nothing in
  Decisions 0044-0047 is reopened. The durability lifecycle stays: full
  deterministic build -> durable `graph.update` -> session working
  overlay, all three layers now additionally metadata-aware rather than
  source-language-only.
- **Persistent parser-tree caching remains deliberately deferred** --
  not attempted, not implied by anything in this checkpoint.
- **Metadata/operational facts are now required before the bounded
  query/orientation layer (ROG-023-026) can be built honestly**: that
  layer needs real dependency, build, package, test, and CI facts to
  answer orientation questions, not only source-symbol facts.

Conceptual design for this checkpoint:

```text
                    SourceProjection
                          |
            +-------------+-------------+

            |                           |
            +-------------+-------------+
                          |
                          v
                  normalized facts
                          |
          +---------------+----------------+
          |               |                |
          v               v                v
      semantic         build/test        package/runtime
        layer             layer               layer
```

All contributions still end in one canonical `RepositoryGraph` -- no
second graph authority is introduced. See Decision 0048 for the schema-
compatibility audit (schema v3 found genuinely necessary) and the
metadata adapter contract, and `implementation-progress.md`'s
metadata-operational-topology-checkpoint section for the full
architecture, test matrix, real AC pending inventory, and evidence.

## 2026-09-14 operational-surface-completion refresh

- **Actual starting SHA:** `542cd5c01a79942ecb78040b19deb4e82f4f9068`
  (the accepted metadata/operational-topology checkpoint, plus three
  intervening unrelated WI022 commits fast-forwarded past cleanly).
- **Coding agent:** Claude Code. **Architecture reviewer:** GPT-5.6 Sol
  High.
- **Schema v3 accepted; ROG-018/021/022 accepted.** Nothing in Decision
  0048 or the prior checkpoint's evidence is reopened.
- **This phase closes the remaining operational topology
  (ROG-004/019 gaps) before the query API.** ROG-024 in particular
  ultimately requires real test/build/runtime/package facts; the graph
  did not yet carry enough of them to build that API honestly.
- **Persistent parser caching remains unjustified and deferred** -- not
  attempted, not implied by anything in this checkpoint.

Intended model:

```text
existing File / Symbol / Manifest nodes
                 |
       deterministic role metadata
                 |
      +----------+-----------+
      |          |           |
    package     test       runtime
      |          |           |
      +------ build/generated+
                 |
                 v
       existing typed graph edges
       + explicit operational role
```

No second graph implementation. Operational meaning is attached to
already-existing File/Symbol/Manifest nodes and already-existing
`GraphEdgeKind`/`GraphLayer` values via a new, additive, open-string
role field (Decision 0049) -- not via new closed enum growth, which
Decision 0048's own compatibility audit already proved would break old
v3 readers exactly like the v1-to-v2 hazard Decision 0045 fixed. See
Decision 0049 and `implementation-progress.md`'s
operational-surface-completion-checkpoint section for the full
architecture, role vocabulary, test matrix, and evidence.

## 2026-09-14 bounded-query-and-orientation-surface refresh

Actual starting SHA `2157494aa28527b753bb46a3d1b5a87c905f20b4` (the
accepted operational-surface-completion checkpoint). Coding agent:
Claude Code. Architecture reviewer: GPT-5.6 Sol High.

Accepted going in: ROG-004 (full relation-taxonomy conjunctive list
genuinely met); ROG-019 remains pending, and remains pending after
this checkpoint too -- its one remaining named gap (test-fixture
topology) is intentionally not closed here, since RepoPact's own
`fixtures/`-named directories stay architecturally invisible to the
graph via the pre-existing `IGNORED_PARTS` exclusion (Decision 0044,
proven by ROG-021), and no included RepoPact source/config metadata
currently names an excluded-fixture-boundary fact to ground a real,
honest fixture relationship. Fabricating one to satisfy an AC is
explicitly out of scope; see Decision 0050 section 10. The durable,
incremental, and working-overlay graph lifecycles (Decisions 0044,
0046, 0047) are accepted and unmodified by this checkpoint.

This checkpoint adds **only read/query capability** -- a typed,
bounded query and orientation surface (ROG-023 through ROG-026) over
the already-materialized graph. It does not add a second graph
builder, does not add a persistent query database, does not touch
`rog/`, and grants no mutation, governance, or lifecycle authority
(ROG-037/040): every query result is read-only structural fact plus
explicit coverage/freshness disclosure, never proof of behavior and
never an approval, waiver, or ownership grant.

```text

                         v
               typed bounded results
```

The query kernel (`repopact_graph::query`) owns no filesystem
crawling, no graph mutation, no durable writes, and no provider/LLM
calls -- it is a pure function of an already-materialized
`RepositoryGraph` (or `SessionGraphState::effective_graph()`) plus a
disposable, in-memory, reconstructed-per-call index (`BTreeMap`-based,
never persisted, never `rog/`-adjacent). See Decision 0050 for the
full query-authority, resolution, bounds, pagination, freshness, and
legacy-`graph`-operation contract, and
`implementation-progress.md`'s bounded-query-orientation-checkpoint
section for the operation list, DTO shapes, test matrix, and evidence.

## 2026-09-14 adoption/backfill/clean-clone-lifecycle refresh

Actual starting SHA `6d47ec5aa17c536e66ee1194318cd25aa557e58c` (12
commits ahead of the bounded-query checkpoint's own end state --
WI020/021/022 bookkeeping, dashboard reconciliation, research/public
docs, and a fix to the date-sensitive `test_takeover_refuses_dir_
with_audit_scope_inside` test; none touch the WI063 graph/query
implementation, confirmed by inspection). Coding agent: Claude Code.
Architecture reviewer: GPT-5.6 Sol High.

Accepted going in: ROG-023 through ROG-026 (the bounded typed query
kernel, reused identically by the engine, CLI, and desktop overlay).
The graph/query stack is now mature enough to integrate with
RepoPact's repository lifecycle -- brownfield adoption, backfill for
already-governed repositories, and the clean-clone success path.

Two invariants govern this checkpoint absolutely:

- **Legacy repositories must remain valid without ROG.** A repository
  that has never enabled ROG, and one that explicitly disabled it,
  are both fully valid RepoPact repositories -- this checkpoint adds a
  capability signal, it does not add a requirement.
- **Graph enablement must be explicit and durable, and can never
  fabricate governance facts.** Enabling ROG is always a deliberate
  act (`graph build`, or adoption's explicit `--graph` opt-in), never
  an automatic side effect of `doctor` or any read-only operation, and
  a graph fact is never promoted into an owner, approval, frozen-
  surface acknowledgement, or evidence record.

                            final validation
```

Enablement happens strictly *after* a valid graph exists -- capability
is the last thing written, never the first (Decision 0051 section 3).
See Decision 0051 for the full five-state capability model
(`LegacyAbsent`/`LegacyEnabled`/`ExplicitDisabled`/`ExplicitEnabled`/
`EnabledMissing`), the `governance/rog-capability.json` declaration
contract, enable/disable ordering, the ignored-artifact guard, and why
capability is read directly rather than represented as a graph node or
a new `RecordKind` variant. See `implementation-progress.md`'s
adoption-backfill-clean-clone-checkpoint section for the full
implementation, test matrix, and evidence.

## 2026-09-14 Workbench operator map and derived-graph branch/merge refresh

```text
coding agent = Claude Code
architecture reviewer = GPT-5.6 Sol High
```

Starting SHA for this refresh: `7c04d02c87b268562bd5959830879581d7a0e1e8`
(the accepted capability/adoption/backfill/clean-clone checkpoint).
ROG-023 through ROG-026, ROG-014/015/016/031/039 are accepted; the
query/capability stack is mature enough to support two further
integrations: an operator-oriented Workbench repository map
(ROG-027/028) and a defined branch/merge contract for derived graph
files (ROG-029).

The key architecture decision, recorded in full in Decision 0052:

```text
ROG data/query kernel
        |
        v
typed desktop query boundary
        |
        v
operator repository map

NOT

raw graph dump
        |
frontend invents traversal/search/impact semantics
```

The frontend must consume the canonical bounded query system. It must
not become a second graph engine. The pre-existing `relationship_graph`
Tauri command (a full, unbounded `GraphView` dump backing the ROG-010/
013 status-disclosure table) is retained unchanged -- it is not this
checkpoint's concern and deleting it would put the already-accepted
ROG-010/013 evidence at risk for no benefit. The new operator map is
additive: a second view inside the existing Graph tab, reached through
exactly one new typed Tauri command, `graph_query(GraphQueryRequest) ->
QueryEnvelope<...>`, backed by the identical `GraphQueryEngine` the
engine binary and CLI already use against
`SessionGraphState::effective_graph()`.

Two further architectural additions, both detailed in Decision 0052:

- `graph.search`, a new bounded, deterministic, in-memory search
  operation in `repopact_graph::query` for the operator search box
  (never a repository scan, never fuzzy/embedding/LLM search) --
  additive to query contract version 1.
- `repopact graph reconcile-merge`, an explicit, never-automatic Git/
  index-mutating command that regenerates `rog/**` from already-merged
  authoritative source after a Git merge leaves derived-only
  conflicts, while treating `governance/rog-capability.json` as
  authoritative configuration a merge conflict in which is never
  auto-resolved in either direction.

See `implementation-progress.md`'s Workbench-operator-map-and-branch-
merge-checkpoint section for the full implementation, test matrix, and
evidence.

## 2026-09-14 closeout-readiness refresh

```text
coding agent = Claude Code
architecture reviewer = GPT-5.6 Sol High
```

Starting SHA for this refresh: `341c29803404c2b1c4dba4c3939dd9c8cc81ae9c`
(the accepted Workbench operator-map + branch/merge checkpoint). The
accepted current stack is now:

```text
durable deterministic ROG
        +
incremental equivalence
        +
working overlay
        +
operational metadata
        +
bounded query kernel
        +
capability/adoption/clean clone
        +
Workbench operator map
        +
derived-graph merge repair
```

The remaining work to reach either full WI063 closure or an honest
closeout-readiness checkpoint is characterization and evidence
synthesis, not new architecture:

```text
fixture-boundary disposition (ROG-019)
platform evidence (ROG-028)
performance/storage characterization (ROG-032)
registered S8 R1 experiment (ROG-033/034)
operator/agent documentation (ROG-035)
authority-boundary closeout (ROG-036/037/040)
final executable evidence synthesis (ROG-038)
```

No new graph architecture is introduced merely because WI063 is near
closeout. Decision 0053 (this checkpoint) binds the fixture-boundary
model, benchmark methodology and pre-registration ordering, the
macOS-evidence policy, the no-paid-provider rule, and the exact
conditions under which ROG-038 and WI063 may actually close.

**Pre-existing external blockers, confirmed again this checkpoint,
never fabricated:**

- **ROG-028 / macOS.** No macOS runner exists anywhere in this
  repository's CI configuration (`.github/workflows/governance.yml`
  and `release.yml` both run `ubuntu-latest` only) and none is
  available in this local environment. No hosted macOS job was created
  or run to manufacture a checkbox.
- **ROG-034 / S8 R1.** Checked `research/amendments/2026-09-12-
  governance-continuity.md`: "No S8 run had been performed when
  H15/S8 was added." Neither the B0 nor R0 condition has ever actually
  executed -- S8 exists only as a frozen, pre-registered protocol. Its
  construct requires a real multi-worker/multi-client handoff matrix
  with actual agent/model runs, which this session has no operator
  authorization to fund (paid model API usage) or fabricate. Per this
  checkpoint's own explicit instruction, ROG-033 (the amendment) can
  still be satisfied on its own; ROG-034 (the executed comparison)
  cannot be honestly satisfied this checkpoint and is recorded as
  blocked on authorized benchmark execution -- not silently skipped,
  not faked.

See `implementation-progress.md`'s closeout-readiness section and the
`20260914-063-closeout-readiness-checkpoint` evidence record for the
full disposition of every remaining AC.
