# 022 — Comparative benchmark suite (S2–S6 / H9–H13)

> **Status**: 🟢 Active
> **Owners**: tooling-owner (lead).
> **Depends on**: [`020`](../020-pactbench/) (shares the multi-arm harness; PactBench is S1).

## Needs you (operator gates)

- **Compute / model access.** Running every study across ≥2 model families needs API keys /
  model access you provision. The harness and pre-registered task sets can be built without
  it; the *results* (AC-3) are gated on run access.
- **Comparative studies.** AC-3 remains operator-gated until a separate multi-family
  comparative programme is authorized.

## Intent

PactBench (`020`) covers S1 (guarantee-violation detection). This item covers the rest of
the comparative programme defined in
[`research/benchmark-protocol.md`](../../../research/benchmark-protocol.md), under one
harness so the arms stay matched:

- **S2** cross-session recovery + efficiency (H9) — SWE-bench Verified / SWE-EVO.
- **S3** multi-agent coordination (H10).
- **S4** context-provisioning token economy (H11) — full-prompt, convention-file,
  RAG, summarized/external memory, on-demand fetch, RepoPact, and the **C2+C3** hybrid;
  reported as a cost-vs-success Pareto frontier and a scaling curve.
- **S5** drift detection / staleness (H12) — convention files vs RepoPact, including
  RepoPact's own longitudinal blind spot (F-011).
- **S6** security (H13) — security-invariant enforcement (S6a) and context-file injection
  resistance (S6b), defensive and sandboxed (threat T8).

These are the paper's quantitative core (§6) and the source of the headline launch
numbers (token economy + guarantee/security catch rates).

## Decisions

Operationalizes hypotheses H9–H13 (protocol amendment 2026-06-24). Fairness and scoping
governed by threats T5, T6, T7, T8.

## Scope

- The shared multi-arm harness, instrumentation, and pre-registered task sets for S2–S6 live
  in the **RepoPact Proving Ground** repo (`benchmarks/`), reusing the PactBench task format.
  This repo holds only the protocol + hypotheses (`research/`) — see work item `020`.
- Results as evidence runs + raw `research/captures/`; figures feed paper §6.
- Out of scope: S1/PactBench (owned by `020`); building the runtime-guard arm beyond a
  thin composition shim (S6 `+ runtime guard` is optional/illustrative).

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1** — multi-arm harness covering S2–S6 with pre-registered task sets.
- **AC-2** — token/cost, drift, and security instrumentation as specified.
- **AC-3** — reproducible results across ≥2 model families with frontier + scaling-curve
  figures; disconfirming results recorded with equal weight.
- **AC-4** — freeze the statistical analysis plan before interpreting any live result.
- **AC-5** — run and capture a three-task RealRunner smoke against one real model.

## Progress (reconciled 2026-09-13)

The deterministic/non-operator-gated tranche is implemented in the isolated Proving
Ground WI022 branch; live-model criteria remain pending. Evidence:
[`20260624-pactbench-harness-selftest`](../../../evidence/runs/20260624-pactbench-harness-selftest.json)
(`partial`).

- **Common substrate:** `repopact.experiment-run.v1` carries study/case/condition,
  fixture/task-set versions, repetition/seed, model identity, policy/scorer versions,
  completion/failure state, per-request and aggregate telemetry, observations, capture
  references, exact command, provenance, and illustrative classification.
- **PactBench** now has **24 tasks**; the registered S1/S6a suite remains unchanged and
  its deterministic selftest is plumbing evidence only.
- **RealRunner:** `repopact.real-runner.v1` is provider-neutral and rejects malformed or
  incomplete telemetry instead of turning it into zeroes. A failed/incomplete response is
  retained as an explicit non-reportable failure.
- **Telemetry v2 checkpoint (2026-09-13):** the additive `repopact.real-runner.v2` /
  `repopact.experiment-run.v2` path is implemented against the installed Codex public
  app-server `thread/tokenUsage/updated` notification. It preserves request-level
  `last` usage, cumulative-ledger reconciliation, cache reads, `cache_write_input_tokens`,
  reasoning output, and pinned-tokenizer context/task attribution. No live model call was
  made in this checkpoint; AC-2 remains pending until the corrected smoke validates the
  complete path. Evidence: [`20260913-wi022-telemetry-v2-checkpoint`](../../../evidence/runs/20260913-wi022-telemetry-v2-checkpoint.json).
- **Next smoke selection (2026-09-13):** before inference, the corrected v2 smoke was
  frozen to 0001 (correctness must-not-weaken), 0002 (security/frozen-surface
  must-not-weaken), and 0021 (legitimate decoy), with 0003 explicitly excluded. The
  task-set digest and both-arm materialization fingerprints are recorded in
  [`20260913-wi022-ac5-v2-selection`](../../../evidence/runs/20260913-wi022-ac5-v2-selection.json).
- **First real smoke (2026-09-13):** the repopact arm ran tasks 0001, 0002, and 0003
  once each on the authenticated Codex CLI runtime. Raw captures and postconditions are
  preserved, but the strict RealRunner envelopes are non-reportable because the runtime
  did not expose the required context-vs-task or cache-adjusted token attribution.
- **Second real smoke (2026-09-14):** after the corrected task-set and v2 public-schema
  fixes were published to proving-ground `master@99b34d8`, one admission probe and exactly
  one v2 app-server invocation each for 0001, 0002, and 0021 completed in fresh isolated+  workspaces. All three envelopes carry public `thread/tokenUsage/updated` request-level
  ledgers, complete cache/context/task attribution, model/provider identity, prompts,
  outputs, deterministic postconditions, and raw captures. The reconciled outcomes were+  `proceeded_safely`, `errored`, and `errored`; these are empirical captured outcomes,+  not a claim of three successful catches. Evidence: [`20260914-wi022-ac5-realrunner-smoke-v2`](../../../evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac5-realrunner-smoke-v2.json).
- **Drivers and registrations:** Proving Ground now has deterministic S2 recovery and
  pinned-bed selectors/materialization from immutable SWE-bench Verified and SWE-EVO
  assets, S3 concurrent isolated-worker scoring, S4 C0-C9
  plus C2+C3 condition validation and cost/success analyses, an S5 shared-envelope
  adapter, and S6b scoring over frozen tasks 0023/0024. Mock/fake outputs are explicitly
  illustrative/non-empirical.
- **Still gated:** S2/S3/S4/S6b live execution and results across ≥2 model families.
  The three-case AC-5 smoke is reportable as a runtime/telemetry acceptance smoke, but its
  outcomes are not promoted to a comparative finding or full-study result.
- **S5 dependency:** WI037 repaired the drift harness's removed flat imports. The
  packaged RepoPact 3.0.2 S5 selftest now passes in the Proving Ground; this does
  not turn deterministic plumbing into a live empirical result.
- **Analysis freeze:** the dated 2026-09-13 amendment in
  [`research/benchmark-protocol.md`](../../../research/benchmark-protocol.md) freezes
  repetitions, seeds, temperature/model/version policy, scorers, paired effects,
  uncertainty, multiplicity, missingness, exclusions, stopping, pricing timestamps, and
  illustrative-vs-reportable treatment.

## Criterion state

- [x] **AC-1** — satisfied for the deterministic benchmark tranche. S2-S6 driver
  boundaries and pre-registrations exist, and the pinned S2 task beds now have a
  reproducible acquisition, source-schema validation, model/evaluation projection,
  base-commit preflight, and offline verification path. Live study execution remains
  separately gated.
- [x] **AC-2** — satisfied. The v2 public app-server path was exercised on three completed
  real-model turns and produced reconciled per-request input/output/cached/reasoning usage,
  context-vs-task attribution, cache-adjusted tokens, requests-per-task, and the explicit+  authenticated-subscription USD policy. The existing deterministic drift and security+  instrumentation remains covered by the prior evidence set.
- [ ] **AC-3** — pending and operator-gated. No results across two model families,
  Pareto frontier, or scaling curve exist.
- [x] **AC-4** — satisfied. The dated 2026-09-13 WI022 amendment freezes the enumerated
  analysis choices before any reportable live result.
- [x] **AC-5** — satisfied. Exactly one fresh v2 real-model invocation completed for each
  pre-registered task 0001, 0002, and 0021 after the admission ledger passed. Each envelope+  has the raw command, actual public provider/model, prompt/output, per-request and+  aggregate telemetry, deterministic grader reconciliation, and raw event capture. The+  historical first smoke remains unchanged and non-reportable; AC-3 was not started.

The 2026-07-26 live check also found that Proving Ground's S5 selftest fails
against the current package boundary because it imports removed flat module
names. Proposed WI 037 owns that repair. Deterministic MockRunner output remains
plumbing evidence only.

## AC-3 execution readiness checkpoint (2026-09-14)

The AC-3 execution substrate is published to Proving Ground
`master@0d43f9da959c57e854caac01e0e18f3195468620`. The shared empirical executor
supports strict study-specific output schemas, public app-server request ledgers,
capture/secret checks, runtime identity, and non-illustrative provenance. Narrow
empirical adapters now exist for S2, S3, S4, S6a, and S6b; S2 remains explicitly
blocked until a functional pinned SWE-bench/SWE-EVO checkout/evaluator is provisioned.
The historical AC-5 v2 adapter and captures remain unchanged in behavior.

S4 runnable conditions C0-C8 plus C2+C3 have frozen local operational semantics in
`2026-09-14.s4-methods.1`: no auxiliary model, embedding API, or memory-service calls;
C5 is an isolated in-memory SQLite store and C7 requires exact RepoPact records with
no full-corpus fallback. S5 is model-independent under
`2026-09-14.s5-model-independent.1`; its 135 deterministic cells are shared rather
than duplicated under two model labels.

The superseding manifest preserves the old 678-cell checkpoint and enumerates 543
logical cells (567 execution slots: 432 live turns plus 135 deterministic S5
observations). The revised budget estimates 3,888 internal inference requests,
92,466,288 point input tokens, 2,119,968 point output tokens, and approximately
13.394 hours, with zero auxiliary model/service calls and zero marginal USD under
the current authenticated subscription policy. This is still pre-inference planning;
no registered AC-3 benchmark cell has been executed.

- [ ] **AC-3** remains pending. The two permitted family admission probes are not
  comparative benchmark evidence and do not satisfy the criterion by themselves.

## AC-3 admission probes (2026-09-14)

The two and only two permitted non-benchmark family admission probes were run from
the published Proving Ground implementation: exactly one `gpt-5.6` probe and exactly
one `gpt-6` probe. Both real model turns completed and both raw empirical captures
passed the secret scan. The model-reported admission JSON was `status: pass` in each
capture, but the parent postcondition checker failed closed while reading the
disposable `admission-result.txt` with Windows `PermissionError [Errno 13]`.

The failed local postcondition is an implementation defect, not comparative result
evidence. No retry was made. No registered AC-3 benchmark cell, S2/S3/S4/S5/S6a/S6b
cell, comparative result, Pareto frontier, or scaling curve was started. Evidence:
[`20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-probes`](../../../evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-probes.json).

- [ ] **AC-3** remains pending and is not admitted for comparative execution. The
  published execution substrate needs a deterministic fix and tests for the local
  Windows result-file postcondition before any further admission attempt.

## AC-3 post-fix admission checkpoint (2026-09-14)

The deterministic Windows postcondition repair was published to Proving Ground
`master@d7be39767bb6336dd1eb9133ec0ee592a5a98d3e`; the two new raw captures were
then published at `master@4bab17bf0e6f4fca68b89ca27490e35cc7af8b6c` under the new
`20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-v2` namespace. The historical failed admission record
and captures remain unchanged.

The shared bounded workspace reader correctly distinguishes Windows sharing/lock
(`winerror=32/33`, retryable) from permanent access denial. The real lock regression
passed, while each fresh model-created result file reproduced `PermissionError`
`errno=13`, native `winerror=5`, after one host read attempt. Both app-server
lifecycle checks and public usage reconciliation passed. No retry was made.

Exactly one fresh `gpt-5.6-luna` and exactly one fresh `gpt-6-astra` admission were
run from the published default branch. Both failed admission on the host-side exact
file postcondition; model JSON and `fileChange` evidence were not promoted to
success. Evidence: [`20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-v2`](../../../evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-v2.json).

- [ ] **AC-3** remains pending and pre-inference blocked by the shared Windows
  access-denied boundary. No registered AC-3 benchmark cell has been executed.

## AC-3 deterministic Windows workspace contract checkpoint (2026-09-14)

The Windows workspace diagnosis and repair were completed without model
inference. A direct sandbox ACL matrix showed the same access-denied result in
Python default temp, explicit `%TEMP%`, a dedicated repository-volume root,
and a dedicated benchmark-workspace candidate root. The causal difference was
the restricted sandbox token's inherited/group-only authorization: a protected
explicit sandbox-user ACE passed both sandbox creation and host reads, while an
explicit sandbox-group ACE alone did not.

Proving Ground published `master@817ac722dafd3784a8eb4821b2a0dcf1b5d68940`
with `EmpiricalWorkspace`, a repository-volume allocator configurable through
`REPOPACT_BENCH_WORK_ROOT`, per-run isolation, approved ACL setup, reparse/path
controls, pre-inference host/direct-sandbox read-write checks, and a normalized
workspace-security fingerprint in provenance. The shared empirical executor
now fails before inference when that contract is not proven; S5 remains
model-independent and the registered matrix is unchanged.

The full proving-ground suite passed 86 tests with one pre-existing
platform-specific symlink skip, and the targeted workspace suite passed 14
tests. No model call was made in this deterministic repair tranche. The two
historical admission records and captures remain unchanged. Evidence:
[`20260914-wi022-ac3-windows-workspace-contract`](../../../evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac3-windows-workspace-contract.json).

- [ ] **AC-3** remains pending. Both model-family admissions still require one
  fresh operator-authorized attempt each. No registered AC-3 benchmark cell
  has been executed.

## Historical AC-3 post-repair admission checkpoint v3 (2026-09-14)

Following the deterministic Windows workspace repair, exactly one fresh
non-benchmark admission was run for each family then permitted by the v2 plan:
`gpt-5.6-luna` and `gpt-6-astra`. Both passed the full admission contract: the workspace
preflight was green, the real app-server turn completed, strict structured
output and telemetry reconciled, the model tool operation completed, the host
read the resulting file with an exact 29-byte match, the empirical envelope
validated, and the secret scan passed.

The two captures are preserved in the new Proving Ground
`20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-v3` namespace at published
`master@9ab390d6f9bdd93ee9da1ff4f7dc89cf0a5f288c`. The prior initial-failure,
post-fix-failure, and deterministic workspace-contract records remain
unchanged. Evidence:
[`20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-v3`](../../../evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac3-admission-v3.json).

This is historical v2 admission evidence only. The later pre-inference amendment
replaced Astra prospectively with Claude Sonnet 5; no comparative benchmark cell
was run from this v2 plan. AC-3 remains pending.

- [ ] **AC-3** remains pending. No registered AC-3 benchmark cell has been
  executed.

## Historical AC-3 whole-program deterministic preflight v2 (2026-09-14)

The published Proving Ground implementation at `master@696f602111c0045d0dd38756376165ed5d2261ba`
completed the whole-program pre-inference preflight for the two families admitted by
the historical v2 plan:
`gpt-5.6-luna` and `gpt-6-astra`. The machine-readable report records **543 READY /
0 BLOCKED** logical cells, 567 execution slots, 432 live model/worker turns, 135
shared deterministic S5 cells, and 408 model-dependent cells. Every cell was
classified `READY`; no registered model-dependent cell was executed.

S2 provisioned four SWE-bench Verified and two SWE-EVO tasks at exact immutable
base revisions, with clean functional model workspaces that contain neither gold
solutions nor hidden test patches, plus separate official evaluator copies using
the registered patch-then-test procedure. S3 passed 24 fake concurrent cells and
48 worker turns with isolation, ACL, rendering, scoring, and cleanup checks. S4
passed 180 fake cells over C0-C8, including C2+C3, with C9 explicitly out of
scope. S5 ran all 135 deterministic cells (15 mutations × 3 conditions × 3
repetitions) with blind-spot and scorer checks. S6a and S6b passed 108 and 24 fake
cells respectively, with no invalid graders. Queue collision, manifest order,
atomic-write, and resumability checks passed for all 543 entries.

Evidence: [`20260914-wi022-ac3-whole-program-preflight`](../../../evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac3-whole-program-preflight.json),
with the full report in the published Proving Ground repository at
`evidence/runs/20260914-wi022-ac3-whole-program-preflight.json`.

**0 model calls in this session.** Comparative inference had not started. This
preflight remains immutable historical v2 evidence; AC-3 remains pending until the
amended live comparative programme is separately authorized and executed.

## Current prospective model-family registration after amendment (2026-09-14)

The active prospective AC-3 pair is now unambiguously:

* `gpt-5.6 / openai / gpt-5.6-luna`
* `claude-sonnet-5 / anthropic / claude-sonnet-5`

This is protocol amendment `2026-09-14.ac3-model-family-amendment.1`, frozen before
any registered model-dependent AC-3 comparative cell was executed. The prior
`gpt-6/openai/gpt-6-astra` admission and preflight material above remain immutable
historical evidence; Astra is not an active prospective participant. The amendment
changes only the second model/provider/runtime family. Task sets, cases, conditions,
repetitions, seeds, scorers, frozen corpus, S4/S5 methods, analysis plan, paired
statistics, uncertainty/multiplicity/missing-run/stopping rules, S2 beds, S3 topology,
and S6 graders are unchanged.

The explicit limitation is: **Model family is confounded with provider/agent runtime in
the cross-family comparison. Within-family baseline-vs-RepoPact treatment comparisons
remain matched because each family's arms use the same provider/runtime configuration.**
No absolute Luna-vs-Sonnet difference is a pure model-family effect. AC-3 remains
pending and comparative execution remains resource-deferred.

## AC-3 prospective amendment and Sonnet admission checkpoint (2026-09-15)

The protocol amendment `2026-09-14.ac3-model-family-amendment.1` is now implemented
and admitted exactly one non-benchmark Claude Code runtime probe. The exact reported
identity was `claude-sonnet-5 / anthropic / claude-sonnet-5`, using Claude Code 2.1.268,
structured `stream-json`, four request-level usage records, and no registered AC-3
benchmark cell. The host verified the exact result-file bytes, the empirical envelope,
workspace containment, cleanup, and secret scan. No Luna or Astra call was made in this
checkpoint.

Evidence: [`20260915-wi022-ac3-sonnet-admission-evidence-v1`](../../../evidence/runs/20260915-wi022-ac3-sonnet-admission-evidence-v1.json),
[`20260915-wi022-ac3-execution-manifest-v3`](../../../evidence/runs/20260915-wi022-ac3-execution-manifest-v3.json),
[`20260915-wi022-ac3-whole-program-preflight-v3`](../../../evidence/runs/20260915-wi022-ac3-whole-program-preflight-v3.json), and
[`20260915-wi022-ac3-budget-checkpoint-v3`](../../../evidence/runs/20260915-wi022-ac3-budget-checkpoint-v3.json).

The amended manifest registers exactly `gpt-5.6/openai/gpt-5.6-luna` and
`claude-sonnet-5/anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`: 543 logical cells, 567 execution slots,
432 live model/worker turns, 135 shared deterministic S5 cells, 408 model-dependent
cells, and 204 logical cells per family. The v3 queue digest changes only because the
prospective Astra IDs were replaced by Sonnet IDs. The deterministic v3 preflight is
`543 READY / 0 BLOCKED`, with zero additional model calls and no S5 rerun.

AC-3 remains pending and comparative execution remains resource-deferred. GPT-6 Astra
is historical evidence only and is not an active prospective participant.
