"""Disposable Git-tracked source-tree fixtures for the regression suite.

Several tests and conformance harnesses need a throwaway *copy* of (most of) the
RepoPact source tree that they can freely mutate, `git init`, and commit to. The
old approach in each caller was an ad hoc ``shutil.copytree(repo_root, dest,
ignore=shutil.ignore_patterns(".git", "__pycache__", "*.pyc"))``, which recursively
copies every other byte under the checkout — including generated build output
such as ``rust/target`` that is not covered by that hand-rolled ignore list. With
a real Rust build present, that turned every fixture into a multi-gigabyte copy,
and with dozens of fixtures created per run (plus nested `git add -A`/gc activity
inside each disposable repo) the effect was multi-gigabyte-per-run storage and
process amplification unrelated to whatever the test was actually checking.

This module is the single place that decides what belongs in a disposable
fixture. It selects files the same way ``git`` itself would report the working
tree: currently tracked files (read from the working tree, not the index blob,
so uncommitted edits participate) plus untracked files that are not ignored.
That automatically excludes ``.git`` (never listed by ``git ls-files``) and any
present-or-future ignored build output (``rust/target``, ``node_modules``,
``__pycache__``, ``dist``, ...) without hand-maintaining a parallel ignore list,
while still letting new, non-ignored development files participate.

Fixtures created here also get automatic Git maintenance disabled locally
(never globally, and never on the real checkout) so a disposable repository
cannot spawn background `gc`/repack activity, and cleanup is unconditional:
callers get a context manager or a `unittest.TestCase.addCleanup`-based helper
so a fixture is removed whether setup, the test body, or a subprocess call
fails.
