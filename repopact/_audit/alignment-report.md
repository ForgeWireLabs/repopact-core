# Tooling Alignment Report

## 2026-09-13 WI037 adopter-boundary reconciliation

- `governance/adopters.json` now describes the five-adopter fleet at the public
  RepoPact 3.0.2 boundary. Moto is a package adopter with a declared
  repository-owned local extension, not a vendored core or checksum overlay.
- `fleet_verify.py` now verifies that a declared package local extension exists
  at the immutable public default head and proves canonical-first invocation of
  the namespaced RepoPact CLI. The contract is adopter-neutral and does not
  encode Moto-specific rules.
- Legacy vendored contract support remains in the verifier for historical or
  separately declared adopters; WI037 no longer declares Moto against obsolete
  upstream scripts.

## 2026-09-10 canonical Rust engine cutover

- WI056 makes the Rust engine the canonical authority for the proven repository,
  validation, dashboard, graph, analysis, and typed work-item mutation surfaces.
- `repopact` remains the Python compatibility CLI. `validate`, `dashboard`, and
  typed work-item commands cross the versioned local JSON engine boundary;
  `validate_repo.py` remains an explicit comparator and retained workflows keep
  their documented Python authority.
- Maturin `bin` packaging installs the platform-native `repopact-engine` beside
  the Python package. WI050 admission/guard/enforcement remains protected and
  Python-owned.

## 2026-09-03 WI050 opt-in provider boundary

- `admission.evaluate_action` checks the adopter-owned policy before guard or
  lease state: no policy and `enabled=false` are valid standalone modes with
  `instruction-only`/`enforcement_required=false`; enabled policy remains
  fail-closed when registration or required provider coverage is absent.
- `repopact.enforcement.EnforcementProvider` is the generic health,
  discovery, authorization, check, delegation, and revoke contract. Adapters
  and providers report separate classes and the resolver computes their
  non-widening intersection. `NativeGuardClient` implements the contract but
  is not its definition; external providers are covered by a fixture without
  built-in guard classes.
- Package metadata keeps `jsonschema` as the base dependency and moves
  cryptography to the optional `enforcement` (and `dev`) extras. No frozen
  schema was changed; `minimum_enforcement` and `failure_mode` retain their
  existing structure while the resolver ensures degraded mode cannot satisfy
  an unmet explicit minimum.

## 2026-09-03 WI050 admission architecture review

- Reviewed validate_repo.py, check_frozen_surface.py, init_repo.py,
  adopt_repo.py, doctor.py, and the CLI against the f2c80b7/WI049
  first-write bypass.
- Current validation and frozen checks remain deterministic repository
  backstops; check-frozen --ack is a caller assertion and is not operator
  proof in the accepted WI050 design.
- Decision 0038 selects a protected guard plus vendor-neutral adapter SPI for
  a later implementation pass. No tooling/runtime behavior or frozen path was
  changed in this architecture phase.

## 2026-09-03 deterministic evidence timestamp chronology

- `validate_repo.validate_evidence` retains ISO-8601 validation for all runs and
  applies the explicit `timestamp_basis: "git-recording"` rule against the first
  recording commit plus a five-minute clock/write tolerance.
- Naive timestamps are UTC; aware timestamps normalize to UTC. Git-free,
  exported, and uncommitted records retain structural validation without a
  fabricated history comparison, preserving deterministic behavior and legacy
  evidence history.
- Regression coverage proves far-future rejection, tolerance/offset/naive and
  historical acceptance, malformed input rejection, Git-free behavior, and
  repeated validation that cannot heal through passage of time. Decision 0037
  records the alternatives and the WI049 reconciliation boundary.

## 2026-09-02 structural worktree-aware contract discovery

- `repo_model.iter_contracts` now prunes same-repository linked worktrees using
  both Git's porcelain worktree registry and embedded `.git` files pointing into
  the primary `.git/worktrees` directory.
- The literal `worktrees` entry in `IGNORED_PARTS` remains as a compatibility
  fallback for stale/orphaned conventional scratch trees with no usable metadata.
- Independent nested repositories with `.git/` directories remain discoverable;
  exported trees and Git-unavailable environments retain deterministic fallback
  behavior.
- Regression coverage includes Windows paths with spaces, real conventional and
  non-conventional linked worktrees, stale linked metadata, nested repositories,
  negative controls, and worktree cleanup.

## 2026-09-02 source_of_truth resolution semantics

- `doctor._dead_source_of_truth` now resolves every path token relative to the
  declaring record's directory, matching decision 0016 and `takeover.py`'s
  preserved leading `../` behavior.
- Bare names are deliberately record-relative; a coincident root-level file
  cannot make a missing sibling target appear healthy.
- Regression coverage exercises nested `../` targets, valid and invalid bare
  targets, root coincidence, and the non-destructive `doctor --fix` contract.

## 2026-09-02 stable source/artifact identity reconciliation

- `validate_repo` now recognizes the exact matching stable tag as a valid
  unlabeled release tree and rejects later package/runtime source at the same
  `VERSION` unless a valid VERSION-pinned `RELEASE_LABEL` is present.
- `package_version` gives labeled development builds deterministic PEP 440
  metadata while preserving the strict `VERSION` adopter compatibility core.
- `release-build` uses the derived artifact identity for wheel/sdist names and
  still performs its independent-export and structural package checks.
- Regression tests cover exact-tag acceptance, unlabeled post-tag rejection,
  labeled development acceptance, and deterministic metadata mapping.

## 2026-07-26 RepoPact 3.0 release boundary

- Decision 0029's package/CLI boundary is released as the approved major version,
  rather than remaining an unreleased source change under the immutable public
  2.3.0 artifact.
- `release-build` constructs artifacts twice from independent exports of the
  committed tree and structurally rejects stale flat modules even if
  `top_level.txt` is misleading.
- Adopter-manifest validation checks declaration structure and local overlay
  integrity; remote version currency remains the fleet verifier's responsibility,
  so package publication and ecosystem rollout are genuinely separate phases.
- The declared development extra installs pytest, Maturin, and twine while the
  required repository suite remains standard-library unittest.

## 2026-07-26 semantic freshness and ledger reconciliation

- Audit registry deadlines now block validation after expiry even if the
  dashboard was regenerated; source review, not projection refresh, is required.
- Upstream research metadata registers every top-level claim document under a
  dated, maximum-30-day review contract. Missing documents and expired contracts
  have regression coverage.
- `repopact new` stamps upstream work items against
  `repopact/schemas/work-item.schema.json` after the package-resource move while
  retaining the conventional root `schemas/` URI in adopter repositories.
- WI 020–022 preserve partial evidence criterion by criterion without converting
  missing launch, benchmark, statistical, or real-model proof into completion.

## 2026-07-26 package-resource seed closure

- Canonical schemas and templates live inside the `repopact` package and ship
  through setuptools package data; the deprecated `data-files` install surface
  is removed.
- `init`, `adopt`, `doctor`, validation, record stamping, conformance, and fleet
  verification resolve packaged resources through `importlib.resources`, while
  adopter repositories retain their conventional root `schemas/` and
  `templates/` copies.
- The protected schema surface moved from `schemas/**` to
  `repopact/schemas/**` with explicit operator approval for WI-036 AC-2.

## 2026-07-26 single-package execution and ownership closure

- The distribution exposes one top-level package, `repopact`; all internal modules use
  package-relative imports and the console script remains the supported interface.
- Seeded repositories contain governed state but no vendored tooling. The installed
  package executes validation, generation, and record-stamping (decision 0029).
- RepoPact enables exact Git-tracked path ownership in `governance/owners.json`.
  Deterministic diagnostics reject both unowned paths and overlapping ownership,
  while adopters can opt into the checkout-relative rule after mapping their tree.
- Test copies exclude virtual environments and build caches, schema validators
  are reused by content, and exported trees skip unnecessary Git probes. These
  remove the dominant local suite-time cost while preserving isolated repository
  state per test.

## 2026-07-22 canonical research metadata and trace repair

- `research/metadata.json` is the machine source for lifecycle states, PactBench task
  count, study/hypothesis mappings, threat identifiers, and the proposed-state trace.
- `validate_research.py` cross-checks repeated human-authored facts without generating
  or token-substituting semantic research claims.
- The normal repository gate activates this check only for the upstream research record,
  so adopters are not required to carry RepoPact's paper metadata.
- Mutation tests reject duplicate/missing threats, a four-state figure, stale task count,
  stale hypothesis range, and pre-2.0 provenance wording.

## 2026-07-18 complete conformance rule coverage

- The conformance manifest now inventories every repository-tree rule named by the
  SPEC and machine-enforced invariants covered by the reference validator.
- Coverage is bidirectional: omitted-rule and unknown-rule mappings fail before
  conformance execution, and repository tests reject undeclared fixture directories.
- Reject fixtures must produce exactly one intended reference violation. The runner
  reports unexpected secondary diagnostics deterministically and fails the case.
- Added provenance acceptance/rejection, lifecycle identity, semantic version,
  schema validity, orphan work, disjoint scope, and missing/stale dashboard cases.

## 2026-07-18 deterministic adopter fleet verification

- Added a versioned, schema-validated public adopter manifest covering exact PyPI
  pins and vendored consumers as distinct contracts.
- `repopact fleet-verify` resolves each declared public default branch, reads its
  version marker at the resolved commit, and fails closed on stale or unreachable
  state while reporting unregistered local candidates separately.
- Vendored parity is checksum-backed: exact files must remain byte-identical and
  declared overlays must reconstruct the adopter bytes from an immutable upstream
  revision. A version marker alone cannot pass.
- `repopact release-closeout` reports package publication and ecosystem rollout as
  separate phases and succeeds only when both have evidence.

## 2026-06-29 proposed lifecycle state (025)

- Added `proposed` to the shared lifecycle model as candidate work that does not
  grant implementation authority.
- Validator accepts structurally valid proposed work items but rejects active or
  completed work that depends on proposed work.
- Bootstrap and CLI record-stamping now create/use `work/proposed/`; conformance
  covers the new lifecycle rule.

## 2026-06-15 adoption surface and hardening (003)

- Records are now validated against `schemas/*.json` via `jsonschema` (decision
  0003); the validator retains cross-record semantic checks. Finding 001 closed.
- Added: audit-finding validation, spec-version check, dependency-cycle detection,
  symbol-level frozen-surface enforcement.
- Added bootstrap (`init_repo.py`) and record-stamping (`new.py`) tooling plus
  `templates/`, making RepoPact installable into a new repository.

## 2026-06-15 governance primitives (002)

- Validator enforces invariants, frozen-surface structure, role/scope references,
  decision and policy front matter, and registry-driven contract coverage.
- Mandatory per-contract `_audit` triples relaxed; an `_audit/` companion is
  validated for completeness only when present (INV-7, policy 001).
- Optional disjoint-active-scope check, off by default.

## 2026-06-14 bootstrap

- The validator is read-only and reports deterministic path-scoped errors.
- Dashboard generation writes only `audits/reports/dashboard.md`.
- Lifecycle-blocking rules have unit-test coverage.

## 2026-07-18 deterministic dashboard enforcement

- `validate_repo.py` compares the committed dashboard with a fresh canonical render
  and rejects missing or stale output.
- The generator no longer embeds its run date, so output stays byte-stable until a
  displayed source value or audit-cadence state changes.
- Bootstrap, adoption, record stamping, plan import, takeover, conformance
  materialization, and doctor repair refresh the derived dashboard as part of their
  governed mutation path.
- Regression tests cover missing/stale rejection, stable rendering, doctor repair,
  and command compatibility.

## 2026-09-03 WI050 implementation pass

- Added the six approved admission schemas only; existing frozen schemas,
  invariants, charter, and workflows remain unchanged.
- Added the vendor-neutral canonical policy core, Ed25519 approval receipts,
  external registration/trust pin, short leases, revocation and delegation
  subset checks, plus fail-closed guard and truthful adapter/platform SPI.
- CLI, validator, doctor, SPEC, guide, tests, and audit inventory now expose the
  opt-in admission plane. Reference adapters are pre-action gates and do not
  claim arbitrary process or filesystem confinement.

## 2026-09-03 WI050 protected enforcement substrate phase

- Replaced the caller-controlled `protected_storage` assertion with a
  backend-owned `BackendAttestation` carrying integrity, service identity,
  protected-state, host-configuration, path, and process facts.
- Added the Windows `RepoPactGuard` installation/status/register/uninstall
  contract, protected runtime/state locations, LocalSystem SCM service host,
  authenticated AF_PIPE protocol, and conservative ACL/interpreter checks.
- Added Linux system-service and macOS launch-daemon backend contracts plus the
  cross-platform `run_admission_platform_conformance` harness. Testing-only
  attestations are explicitly marked and excluded from production proof.
- Current Windows token is non-elevated, so native installation and tamper E2E
  are pending operator elevation; the backend reports `not-covered` and the
  enforced path fails closed rather than using a fake service.

## 2026-09-03 WI050 protected-service correction review

- The prior substrate's ordinary lease dictionary was a client-forgeable
  authority representation. `LeaseStore` now mints opaque high-entropy tokens,
  keeps canonical lease records in the guard process, and invalidates all live
  capabilities on restart; `issue_lease` is retained only as a reference policy
  helper and is not accepted over production IPC.
- `NativeGuardClient` is the production adapter seam for health, discovery,
  authorization, checks, revocation, and delegation. It never reads ProgramData
  state and fails closed on unavailable/spoofed IPC. Service-side delegation
  mints child tokens only after strict-subset validation.
- Windows IPC now has an explicit SDDL DACL and verifies the server PID against
  SCM plus LocalSystem service configuration. Client lease binding is derived
  from the pipe peer (PID, process-start identity, SID where available, and
  transport), not caller-provided session or PID fields.
- The SCM image is machine-wide and contains only the protected state root;
  adoption-id registration directories support multiple repositories and
  linked-worktree common-dir resolution. `guard install --preflight` performs
  all possible checks without mutation, and installation stages/rolls back its
  exact root/service artifacts on failure.
- Native destructive proof remains intentionally unrun. AC-14, AC-15, AC-16,
  and AC-18 remain pending until elevated installation and real cross-process,
  multi-repository, and three-OS evidence exist.

## 2026-09-03 WI050 interpreter trust-chain correction review

- Windows guard installation accepts an explicit `--interpreter`; omitted
  selection is still recorded as the canonical `sys.executable` candidate and
  receives identical validation. The selected canonical path is persisted in
  the install manifest and exact SCM command.
- Preflight executes that candidate with Python `-I` and hostile Python
  environment variables, performs Ed25519 verification, and records actual
  cryptography/native module origins. The service command uses the same
  isolated mode and the protected installed runtime path.
- Every required origin and its parent chain is rejected when it is in a
  checkout, `.venv`, known user-writable root (including user site, AppData,
  TEMP, and Downloads), reparse hierarchy, or broad-user-writable ACL. A
  dependency failure is non-mutating and leaves `mutations=[]`.
- Native installation remains unperformed; AC-14, AC-15, AC-16, and AC-18
  remain pending, and Linux/macOS proof remains reserved for their machines.

## 2026-09-15 WI050 closeout tranche

- Authorization requests now enforce each selected profile's
  `max_duration_seconds` at request construction. A caller-supplied later
  expiry cannot widen the profile's lease ceiling.
- Windows attestation now requires the SCM service PID, LocalSystem identity,
  configured executable, live process image, protected runtime/state parent
  chains, digest, and ACL checks to agree. Named-pipe client verification also
  rejects a server whose live image does not match its SCM configuration or
  whose executable path is not host-protected.
- Added the provider-neutral Unix listener/service host and made the Unix
  client verify a root-owned, non-world-writable endpoint plus kernel-reported
  server peer credentials. The listener refuses to replace a pre-existing
  endpoint. This is an implementation boundary, not native Linux evidence.
- The platform conformance runner now executes real process-shaped Python,
  shell, PowerShell/`cmd` where available, nested-CWD, child-process, and
  direct-callback denial cases through the explicit testing backend. It records
  before/after sentinel hashes and labels the result `pre-action`; no
  process/path confinement claim is derived from this matrix.
- The live host has no elevated Windows service, ProgramData installation, or
  WSL2/Linux environment. AC-15, AC-16, and AC-18 therefore remain pending;
  AC-14 is reconciled by the fresh closeout evidence after the implementation
  and product-surface audit.

## 2026-09-15 WI050 optional Landlock confinement implementation

- Added the Linux-only `repopact-confinement` crate and `repopact-sandbox`
  launcher. The launcher is a consumer of protected guard authority: it sends
  the signed request/receipt over its own Unix transport peer, validates the
  guard-derived metadata, compiles a non-broadening path ceiling, sanitizes
  inherited descriptors, sets `no_new_privs`, applies Landlock, and only then
  executes explicit argv.
- The minimum advertised contract is Landlock ABI 3 with all RepoPact
  mutation rights, including ABI-2 `REFER` and ABI-3 `TRUNCATE`. Unsupported
  ABI, unavailable/disabled Landlock, ruleset or restriction errors,
  unrepresentable roots, or invalid guard authority fail before target start.
- Added `LandlockConfinementProvider` and `LandlockSandboxAdapter` as an
  opt-in capability composition. Ordinary `NativeGuardClient` plus
  `PreActionAdapter` remains `pre-action`; sandbox capability requires a
  protected helper and its native mutation probe. Lease revalidation uses a
  read/orientation guard check while the helper supplies the actual kernel
  boundary, so a weak guard cannot be mistaken for process confinement.
- The implementation is portable-tested and Windows-compiled in this
  checkout, but no Linux kernel is available here (`wsl.exe` reports WSL is not
  installed). AC-16 remains pending until the required Debian/ext4 native
  adversarial matrix proves the full process-tree boundary. AC-18 remains
  pending for the independent Windows/Linux/macOS native reference proofs.

## 2026-09-16 WI050 Linux-native Landlock proof reconciliation

- The prior unavailable-host note remains historical evidence and is not
  rewritten. A Linux-native Debian 13/WSL2 ext4 checkout was subsequently used
  with the installed dependencies and a root-owned systemd guard.
- The protected service was corrected to expose repositories read-only under
  systemd `ProtectHome=read-only`; Unix dispatch errors now return a versioned
  fail-closed response before connection close. The Rust launcher root-walk
  regression and Python IPC regression are covered by tests.
- Evidence run `20260916-050-linux-landlock-native-proof` records Landlock ABI
  7, the root-owned helper hash, a 44/44 native matrix, six positive
  executions, OS-boundary denials, nested/linked-worktree and symlink escapes,
  inherited-FD closure, request-integrity rejection, expiry, revocation,
  authority drift, and service-loss/detached-descendant termination. AC-16 is
  satisfied for the Linux reference path;
  AC-18 remains pending for independent native Windows and macOS proofs.
