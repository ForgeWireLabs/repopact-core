# Operating Workflow

## 0. Honor the pact

Before anything else, the invariants in [`invariants.json`](invariants.json) are
binding. If a task would weaken one, stop and follow its escalation path — flag it
and obtain explicit operator approval — rather than implementing it. Check the
[frozen surface](frozen-surface.json): changes to protected paths or symbols need
operator approval (`INV-6`); `scripts/check_frozen_surface.py` is the backstop.

## 1. Capture intent

Create `work/proposed/NNN-short-name/` for candidate work that is not yet
authorized, or `work/active/NNN-short-name/` for accepted work ready for design or
implementation. Each item contains `README.md` and `work-item.json`. State the
outcome, boundaries, dependencies, risks, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Resolve authority

Read applicable `AGENTS.md` files. Record `owner_scope` and any affected scopes.
One scope leads; additional scopes are reviewers or separately sequenced changes.
Roles and their scopes are declared in [`owners.json`](owners.json). Keep each
change inside one role's scope (the non-overlap principle).

## 3. Lock decisions

Material decisions belong in the work-item README with rationale and rejected
alternatives. When a choice is hard to reverse and will outlive this work item —
an architectural or policy-shaping choice — promote it to a record in
[`decisions/`](../decisions/) so its rationale survives the work item's closure.

## 4. Execute

Keep changes inside declared scope. Update the work item as facts change. A plan
may evolve, but the record must show the evolution rather than overwrite it.

## 5. Produce evidence

Create an evidence run manifest from `schemas/evidence-run.schema.json`. Evidence
records commands, results, environment, artifacts, and the acceptance criteria it
supports. Failed runs are retained when they explain a decision or blocker.

## 6. Reconcile

Update affected audit registry rows and findings. An audit answers whether the
declared system and implemented system agree; it is not a second backlog.
Regenerate derived artifacts (the dashboard) rather than editing them by hand.

## 7. Transition state

- `proposed`: captured but unauthorized candidate work; it records possible
  intent but does not grant implementation authority.
- `active`: accepted and authorized for design or implementation.
- `blocked`: accepted/current work that cannot progress until a named condition changes.
- `deferred`: accepted but intentionally postponed with rationale and revisit trigger.
- `completed`: acceptance criteria satisfied with evidence.

Move the entire directory and update `status`. Never copy only the final summary.
