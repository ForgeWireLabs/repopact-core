# Pre-publication gap audit — 2026-07-15

A hard look at everything backing the paper — adopter repositories, conformance
suite, tests, benchmarks, research record, and release/CI substrate — with the
paper deadline set for **end of August 2026**. Each finding states what was
verified, why it matters, and the concrete move. Severity reflects impact on the
paper's credibility, not effort to fix.

**Method.** Every adopter repo was validated against the current (2.1.0)
validator; the conformance manifest was diffed against the SPEC §4 rule set and
the formal model's claims; the proving-ground harness and drift selftests were
executed; the research record was cross-checked against the paper's citations;
work-ledger and CI state were inspected directly. Numbers below are from those
runs, not from memory.

**Archive/status clarification (2026-09-24).** The observations above are from
2026-07-15, with the separately dated disposition check from 2026-07-26. Their
release identities, deadlines, adopter results, CI state, and open actions are
historical and are not a September 2026 status report. The current research
review is recorded in `research/README.md`; re-verify a specific gap against its
current evidence before treating it as open or closed today.

**Freshness contract.** The original observations remain dated 2026-07-15.
Current dispositions were re-verified on **2026-07-26** and must be reviewed by
**2026-08-09** under policy `002` and `research/metadata.json`.

## Current disposition — 2026-07-26

without rewriting what was observed on 2026-07-15.

| Gap | Disposition | Durable owner or evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GA-1 adopter validation | **reopened: 3 of 5 stale** | 2.2.0 rollout remains historical evidence; current 2.3 reconciliation proposed as WI 037 |
| GA-2 missing proposed-state trace | **closed** | F-014, capture 013 / WI 031 |

## GA-1 — Two flagship adopters fail current validation (critical)

Validated with `python scripts/validate_repo.py --root <repo>` on 2026-07-15:

| Adopter | Result | Error classes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| repopact-proving-ground | **pass** | — |
| ForgeLink | **pass** | — |
| moto-one-hyper | **pass** | — |
| forgewire | **39 errors** | 16 × unknown `affected_scope`, preflight-marker drift, others |
| skillforge-academy | **42 errors** | all preflight-marker drift (2.0 mandatory-preflight epoch) |

The paper cites forgewire (F-007) and SkillForge (F-012, F-013) as adoption
evidence. A reader who clones them and runs current `repopact validate` finds the
paper's own evidence base non-conformant. This is the F-011 longitudinal-drift
class recurring in the wild — which is an opportunity: run `doctor` upgrades on
both and capture the episode as fresh T7/ratchet evidence (currently `[conj]`,
partial). If `doctor` cannot repair the unknown-scope class, that is a new honest
finding about `doctor` coverage. Either outcome strengthens the paper.

**Move.** `doctor --fix` both repos from the 2.1.0 package; capture; new findings
register entries; re-validate.

**2026-07-26 update.** The completed five-adopter 2.2.0 rollout remains valid
historical evidence, but it does not prove current fleet state. Running
`repopact fleet-verify` against immutable public default-branch heads found
ForgeLink, ForgeWire, and RepoPact Proving Ground still declaring 2.2.0 while
RepoPact's public current release is 2.3.0. SkillForge passes with an exact 2.3.0
pin; Moto passes the stronger checksum-backed vendored overlay proof. The
current-release obligation is reopened and routed to proposed WI 037 rather than
silently rewriting or repeating the 2.2.0 rollout.

## GA-2 — The proposed-state episode has no finding or capture (critical)

Paper §6.4 narrates the `proposed` lifecycle episode (decision `0023`, work item
`025`, downstream adopter `moto-one-hyper-forgewire-rom-lab`) as a result — but
[`findings.md`](findings.md) stops at F-013 and [`captures/`](captures/) stops at
012. A paper whose thesis is "every claim traces to a typed record" cites an
episode with no register entry.

**Move.** Add **F-014** to the register and **capture 013** documenting the
adopter pressure, the gap analysis, and the resolution chain (decision 0023 →
WI 025 → schema/CLI/conformance → release 2.1.0, decision 0024).

**2026-07-22 update.** Closed by F-014 and capture 013. The trace now includes the
originating Moto adopter commit, decision 0023, WI 025 implementation evidence,
schema/CLI/semantic/conformance behavior, decision 0024 and release tag 2.1.0, and the
later public fleet rollout evidence.

## GA-3 — CI is dead, and CI is the thesis (critical, operator-gated)

GitHub Actions has been **billing-locked since June**; `governance.yml` fails in
~5 s on every push and `release.yml` cannot publish. The paper's enforcement
story is "invalid states are rejected at the commit/CI checkpoint" and Appendix B
tags T5 as `[ci]` — but the flagship repo's checkpoint has not executed for a
month, and a reviewer who opens the Actions tab sees a wall of red. This also
means all recent testing is Windows-local only, so the cross-platform claim is
currently unexercised (the 2.0.2 seed-lookup bug was itself Windows-specific —
platform coverage is not hypothetical).

**Move (operator).** Clear the billing lock, or move the gates to a free CI
alternative before submission. Re-enables trusted publishing as a side effect.

**2026-07-18 update.** The billing lock remains. RepoPact 2.2.0 therefore uses the
documented direct-PyPI fallback, with exact artifact hashes, public-index verification,
and a clean-environment install captured as release evidence. This restores package
publication but does **not** close GA-3: cross-platform CI and the repository checkpoint
remain unavailable. Separately, 2.2.0 moves dashboard projection equality into the
one-tree validator, so that particular fixpoint no longer depends exclusively on CI.

## GA-4 — Conformance suite: 8 cases; the 2.0 headline feature has zero (high)

Current cases: valid-minimal, valid-proposed-work, active-depends-on-proposed,
completed-with-pending, satisfied-without-evidence, unknown-dependency,
unregistered-contract, dependency-cycle.

**Not covered by any fixture:**

- **Provenance (`I_prov`) — nothing.** No rejection for completed-but-provisional,
  none for concrete work resting on inferred evidence, no valid
  inferred/provisional acceptance case. The central 2.0 contribution is
  conformance-untested.
- **Status–directory mismatch (`I_ID`)** — F-004 is a flagship "holds" in the
  paper with no conformance case.
- Version format (`I_ver`), schema-invalid record (`I_struct`), orphan work dirs
  (`I_orphan`), disjoint active scopes (`I_conc`).

[`formal-model.md`](formal-model.md) T1 claims "one invalid overlay per §4 rule"
— currently false.

**Move.** Grow the suite to ~14–15 cases (one rejection per machine-checkable
rule, plus provenance accept/reject pairs); until then, weaken the T1 wording.

**2026-07-26 update.** Closed. The current conformance manifest declares all 17
machine-enforced repository-tree rules and maps them bidirectionally to 20
isolated accept/reject cases. WI 030 owns the closure; the extra release-surface
case added later remains covered.

## GA-5 — No statistical plan in the benchmark protocol (high)

[`benchmark-protocol.md`](benchmark-protocol.md) pre-registers hypotheses,
metrics, and falsification criteria, but contains **no** sample sizes,
repetition counts, seed policy, temperature policy, effect-size or
confidence-interval plan, or multiple-comparison handling across six studies.
Agents are stochastic; one run per task per arm is an anecdote, and
pre-registration without an analysis plan erodes the pre-registration claim.

**Move.** Dated amendment before real runs: runs-per-task-per-arm (e.g. 3–5
seeds), rubric version pinning, analysis plan (proportions with Wilson CIs,
paired per-task comparison), and a stopping rule.

**2026-07-26 update.** Still open as WI 022 AC-4. No dated statistical
amendment satisfying the enumerated analysis choices exists, and no live result
may be interpreted before it does.

## GA-6 — All comparative results remain operator-gated; RealRunner untested (high, schedule risk)

S1 (24 PactBench tasks) and S5 (drift harness) selftests pass and are runnable
today — blocked only on **API keys for ≥2 model families**. Working back from
end-of-August: keys by ~end of July → S1+S6 early August → S5 mid-August →
freeze. If keys slip, every value claim ships "forthcoming."

**RealRunner has never executed a real agent.** A 3-task, one-model smoke run
now would de-risk the "subprocess interface for real agent runs" claim before
the results section is bet on it.

S2/S3/S4 have no harness. Realistic triage: implement **S4** (token economy —
no SWE-bench dependency; Figure 5 is the headline figure) as the second study;
explicitly defer S2/S3 in the paper.

**2026-07-26 update.** Still open. Proving Ground's deterministic 24-task
PactBench selftest and its two built fixture suites pass. S2, S3, S4, and S6b
drivers remain absent; there is no three-task RealRunner smoke and no result
bundle from two model families. The S5 selftest now fails at import because it
uses removed flat module names rather than `repopact.*`; WI 037 owns that
downstream package-boundary repair. These are plumbing and readiness facts, not
agent-behavior findings.

## GA-7 — Publication logistics with lead times (high, operator-gated)

- **No renderable figures exist.** [`figures.md`](figures.md) is ASCII mockups;
  arXiv needs SVG/TikZ for Figures 1–3 and a matplotlib pipeline for 4–6.
- **No markdown→LaTeX/PDF pipeline; no bibliography.** Appendix E says of itself
  "not citation-complete." BibTeX collection is slow — start now.
- **arXiv cs.SE endorsement** for a first-time submitter can take weeks; the
  account + endorsement request should happen in July, not August. Same for the
  2–3-week HN karma warm-up (work item `021`).

**2026-07-26 update.** Still open. No repository evidence proves operator
approval of the private launch assets, an arXiv submission, a designated PyPI
*launch* release, or a Show HN post. The published 2.1.0, 2.2.0, and 2.3.0
infrastructure releases are not retroactively relabelled as the public launch.
Renderable figures, bibliography, and a paper build pipeline remain publication
work rather than completed WI 021 criteria.

## GA-8 — Stale and inconsistent documents (medium)

- [`threats-to-validity.md`](threats-to-validity.md) has a **duplicate T7**
  (two "Token-measurement fairness" sections) and is **missing T9 (provenance
  misuse) and T10 (standard–implementation coupling)**, which exist in the paper.
- [`figures.md`](figures.md) predates 2.0: Figure 2 shows the four-state
  lifecycle (no `proposed`); Figure 3's caption calls provenance "the principled
  *future* escape" (it shipped in 2.0); Figure 6 says "21 pre-registered tasks"
  (there are 24).
- [`benchmark-protocol.md`](benchmark-protocol.md) intro says the studies
  "operationalize hypotheses H8–H10" but defines six studies through H13.
- **The proving ground pins a git commit, not PyPI**
  (`repopact @ git+…@d1d5f81`) while the paper says it "consumes RepoPact from
  PyPI." Re-pin to `repopact==2.1.0`; re-run selftests and validation.

**2026-07-18 update.** The Proving Ground now pins formal PyPI release
`repopact==2.2.0`; governance, unit, PactBench, and drift selftests pass. The rollout
also verified ForgeLink, SkillForge, ForgeWire, and Moto One Hyper on 2.2.0 at their
public default-branch heads. This closes the package-pin bullet, not the other stale-doc
items in GA-8.

**2026-07-22 update.** Closed. `research/metadata.json` now owns the lifecycle states,
24-task PactBench count, S1–S6/H8–H13 mapping, T1–T10 identifiers, and proposed-state
trace. The repository gate cross-checks the paper, figures, protocols, threat register,
and benchmark ledger; regressions deliberately reintroduce every stale-fact class.

**2026-07-26 update.** The upstream canonical facts remain closed and now carry
an enforceable review deadline. The downstream Proving Ground slice is reopened:
it pins 2.2.0 while 2.3.0 is current, two benchmark READMEs point at a nonexistent
local `research/` tree, and the S5 harness uses the removed flat import surface.
Proposed WI 037 owns those external repairs.

## GA-9 — Ledger hygiene in our own repos (medium)

- Work items `020`/`021`/`022` have acceptance criteria with **empty
  descriptions** in `work-item.json`; the meaning lives only in READMEs — a mild
  H6 (recover-from-records) violation in our own ledger.
- The proving ground's work ledger holds one completed item while an entire
  benchmarks tree was built there. Either backfill work items or explicitly
  record that PG work is authorized from the repopact ledger — a cross-repo
  authority gap at L5 the paper could name rather than hide.
- Work item `021` AC-3 (PyPI launch release) is `pending` although 2.1.0
  published 2026-07-15; decide whether 2.1.0 is the launch release and, if so,
  satisfy AC-3 with an evidence run.

**2026-07-26 update.** Closed by WI 033 without manufacturing completion:

- WI 020 now records substantive criterion text. Its protocol-only standard
  boundary and remotely verified 24-task Proving Ground placement are satisfied;
  cross-repository reference consistency remains pending because the Proving
  Ground links are broken and current-release coherence is open.
- WI 021 remains entirely pending. No earlier package release is relabelled as
  the operator-approved public launch.
- WI 022 links its deterministic partial foundation while keeping all S2–S6
  completeness, instrumentation, statistical, real-model, and comparative-result
  criteria pending.
- Policy `002` and validator regressions make expired audit and research review
  contracts fail instead of allowing a canonical dashboard to mask stale claims.

## GA-10 — Independence of the evidence base (medium, standing)

All conformant adopters are ForgeWireLabs repositories. Flask (F-009) is the
only non-org datum and exists only as a local capture. Threats T1/T2 remain the
paper's soft underbelly. One genuinely third-party adopter before August would
be worth more than any documentation polish; publishing the flask adoption as a
reproducible script is the cheap version.

**2026-07-26 update.** Still open as WI 034. No public, independently executed
reproduction beyond ForgeWireLabs-controlled repositories was found or claimed.
