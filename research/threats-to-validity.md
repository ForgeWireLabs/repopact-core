# Threats to validity

Recorded so the paper's evaluation cannot be read as stronger than it is. Updated as
threats are identified or retired.

## T1 — Reflexivity / progenitor adoption (the central threat)

RepoPact was not designed in the abstract and then tested on forgewire. It was
**distilled from forgewire's own working practices**: the tiered `AGENTS.md`
contracts, the `_audit` inventory/alignment system, todos, logs, history, and
trackers. Consequently:

- forgewire adopting cleanly (capture 004, F-007) is **confirmatory**, not
  independent — the architecture is meeting the project it was abstracted from. It
  proves the `adopt` tooling works and that the kernel re-integrates into its source
  in a structured, explainable way; it does **not** prove the model generalizes.
- The greenfield proving ground (`unitconv`) was author-built specifically to
  exercise RepoPact, so it shares the same author-as-evaluator bias.

**Mitigation (in progress).** Adopt repositories with **no lineage to RepoPact** and
report the result whether it holds or cracks.
- *Done:* pallets/flask (F-009, capture 006) — an unrelated OSS project reached a
  conformant RepoPact via `adopt`. This independently exercises the workflows + sparse
  path.
- *Done:* SkillForge Academy (F-012, capture 011) — an independent, different-domain
  real app (Tauri cert-learning) ran the full adopt+import-plan+doctor lifecycle to
  conformant, non-destructively. Adds an independent datum for flat-todo + sectioned-
  roadmap import and for coexistence with a homegrown audit/tracking system.
- *Still open:* an independent repo that also has CODEOWNERS and nested contracts, so
  those mappings are shown to generalize beyond the progenitor (forgewire). SkillForge
  has neither, so the CODEOWNERS/nested-contract generality still rests on forgewire.

## T2 — Single evaluator, single session

All evidence was produced by one operator/agent pair in one session. No independent
re-runner has reproduced the captures. **Mitigation:** every run links a raw capture
and the exact commands, so the procedure is reproducible by a third party.

## T3 — Scale and domain narrowness

The greenfield subject is trivial (a unit converter); the brownfield subject is a
single application. The record formats may strain on very large monorepos, polyglot
trees, or unusual `_audit` layouts. **Mitigation:** the conformance fixtures
(`tests/fixtures/`) and additional adopters broaden coverage over time.

## T4 — "Holds" findings are absence-of-failure

A finding marked *holds* means a specific adversarial case was caught; it is not a
proof that no bypass exists. **Mitigation:** treat the hypothesis list as falsifiable
and additive, not as a closed proof.

## T5 — Benchmark selection and task curation (for H8–H13)

The comparative studies (`benchmark-protocol.md`) are only as honest as their task sets.
Hand-curating PactBench (S1) toward cases RepoPact handles well, or selecting SWE-bench /
SWE-EVO slices that favour the governed arm, would manufacture the result.
**Mitigation:** the PactBench task set and each study's "correct outcome" are
pre-registered and committed before runs (no post-hoc curation); task-set versions are
recorded per run; results are reported across at least two model families so a finding is
not a single-model artefact.

## T6 — Baseline fairness / construct validity (for H8–H13)

A comparative win is meaningless if the baseline is a strawman. Comparing a
RepoPact-governed repo against an *empty* repo would measure "having any context" rather
than "having RepoPact." **Mitigation:** the baseline arm carries a genuine, reasonable
`AGENTS.md` and README over identical source; only the governance layer differs; the
ceremony cost of RepoPact is counted *against* it (an efficiency gain that is cancelled
by governance overhead is reported as such, per ¬H9).

## T7 — Token-measurement fairness (for S4 / H11)

Token economics depend on the tokenizer, the model, prompt **caching**, and provider
pricing. Stable context (convention files, repo records) is cache-friendly; per-request
RAG injections vary and bust the cache, changing real cost. Measuring raw tokens without
accounting for caching/pricing misstates the comparison in either direction.
**Mitigation:** fix tokenizer + model per run; hold *corpus content* constant across
regimes so we compare the delivery mechanism, not the content; report raw tokens,
cache-adjusted tokens, and USD at stated rates; measure per-request *and* per-task
(amortized) so on-demand-fetch regimes are not flattered by a cheap first request.

## T8 — Drift / security task realism and responsible scoping (for S5–S6 / H12–H13)

Induced drift and security temptations must be realistic, not toy, or the results are
theatre. Security work must also stay defensive. **Mitigation:** drift mutations and
security tasks are pre-registered and reviewed for realism; security tasks are
**defensive, sandboxed, and benign-by-construction** (no real exploit development, no live
targets); RepoPact's own records and evidence are evaluated *as an attack surface* (no
immunity assumption); injection corpora are synthetic and contained. RepoPact is framed as
**composing with** runtime guards (e.g. LGA, arXiv:2603.07191), not replacing them.

## T9 — Provenance misuse

Provenance typing can be misunderstood. If users treat `inferred` or `provisional`
records as equivalent to concrete proof, the type system loses its value. **Mitigation:**
completion cannot rest on non-concrete evidence; provenance remains visible in generated
surfaces and review; doctor ratchets only when concrete evidence exists. Comparative and
longitudinal work must still test whether operators honor the distinction in practice.

## T10 — Standard versus implementation coupling

The reference validator defines RepoPact's current operational semantics. This is useful
for precision but risks coupling the standard to one Python implementation.
**Mitigation:** the independently consumable conformance corpus maps standard rules to
accept/reject fixtures and can run alternative validators. The corpus narrows coupling;
it does not replace an independent implementation and third-party reproduction.

## T11 — Workbench maturity

The existence of a polished-looking UI can create a false impression that every governance
capability has reached operator parity. UI claims must distinguish between implemented,
wired, validated, and merely planned controls. **Mitigation:** missing operator controls
remain visible as release work rather than being hidden by overall visual quality.

## T12 — Orientation mechanism bias

A future repository graph could be designed around the same tasks later used to evaluate
it. **Mitigation:** S8 reduces this risk by registering correctness and orientation-cost
measures before graph design and by requiring any graph-enabled condition to be added
through a new dated amendment before graph-condition runs.
