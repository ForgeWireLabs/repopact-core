## Abstract

Agentic software engineering increasingly distributes work across humans, coding agents,
machines, model providers, and execution sessions. Yet the state that governs that work,
including intent, authority, invariants, decisions, acceptance criteria, provenance, and
evidence, often remains outside the software artifact itself. It lives in conversations,
local agent memory, issue trackers, private planning state, runtime-specific context, or one
operator's head. When a session ends or a different worker takes over, the repository may
preserve the code while losing the governing state required to change that code safely.

We present **RepoPact**, a repository-native governance kernel for durable human-agent
software engineering. RepoPact stores governing project state as typed, version-controlled
records alongside the artifact being governed. A fresh human or agent can therefore clone a
repository and recover not only its source tree, but also its declared work state, authority
boundaries, binding invariants, decisions, evidence, provenance, and lifecycle without
requiring the previous worker's local context or agent runtime. Humans and agents operate
over the same governed substrate rather than maintaining separate control planes.

RepoPact organizes this substrate into six layers, L0 through L5: a typed record store,
work-item lifecycle automata, an invariant monitor, a typed enforcement lattice,
deterministic derived views, and a brownfield adoption boundary. Its distinguishing
primitive is the **binding invariant**, a declared guarantee coupled to rationale,
escalation, and, where logically possible, machine enforcement. We formalize repository
conformance, introduce **governance continuity** as the recoverability of represented
governed state across worker and session transitions, characterize invariant classes by the
information required to enforce them, and identify a concrete-record brownfield trilemma
for epistemically uncertain reconstruction. Provenance-typed records, `concrete`,
`provisional`, and `inferred`, resolve that uncertainty class without representing
reconstructed state as established fact. Structural contradictions in legacy state remain
explicit migration residue rather than being hidden by provenance.

We evaluate RepoPact reflexively and adversarially using its packaged implementation,
conformance suite, recorded findings, naturalistic case studies, and a pre-registered
comparative benchmark program. The implementation has evolved from a Python reference
system into a canonical Rust semantic engine consumed by compatibility tooling and a Tauri
2 Workbench, while preserving repository-level interoperability. RepoPact 3.1.0 is the
stable public boundary and ships the canonical engine, local-first verification/release
surface, additive graph capability, and optional assurance-mapping capability in the
Python/Rust package. WI063's graph implementation is substantially operational but remains
active at 37/40 satisfied criteria; WI065's app-private mobile acquisition checkpoint is
real but active at 4/9 satisfied criteria. Windows, Linux, and Android evidence exists for
the Workbench, while macOS and iOS still require platform-specific validation. RealRunner
has crossed the real-model-exercised boundary, but comparative cross-model results remain
pending and will be reported whether they confirm or challenge the claims.

## 1. Introduction

A coding agent is given a task, loads context, changes code, and finishes a session. The
next session may use a different model, a different machine, a different developer, or the
same agent after its context has been reset. The source code survives, but the reason the
change was safe may not.

The missing state is often more important than a forgotten fact. It includes what the work
was trying to accomplish, what was authorized, what must not be weakened, which decisions
were already made, what counts as completion, what evidence exists, what remains uncertain,
and what should happen next. These facts are commonly scattered across chat logs, prompt
transcripts, local scratchpads, issue trackers, private planning documents, model memory,
and operator knowledge.

We originally described this primarily as **session amnesia**. That remains a useful
symptom, but it is not the whole problem. The deeper problem is **governance
discontinuity**. A project may preserve its files while losing the durable state that tells
the next worker how those files may legitimately change.

This distinction matters because software work is no longer performed by one stable actor.
A repository may move from a human developer to one coding agent, from that agent to
another, from one workstation to another, from a CLI to a graphical operator, or from a
local session to a clean clone. If the governing state only exists inside one worker's
context, every handoff is a partial reset.

RepoPact starts from a simple observation: the repository is the one artifact every
legitimate participant already has to obtain. It is persistent, diffable, reviewable,
replicated, branchable, and already tied to the code, tests, history, and change-control
mechanisms software engineering trusts. RepoPact makes that same repository carry the
durable state required to govern the work.

The central idea is:

> A fresh human or agent should be able to clone the repository and recover not only the
> code, but the governed state needed to continue the work responsibly.

That makes the repository a **rendezvous point** between humans and agents. The UI does not
own a separate truth. The agent runtime does not own a separate truth. A chat transcript
does not own the project state. A local database does not own it. The repository owns the
durable contract.

This does not mean every useful fact must live in Git, or that runtime memory is
unnecessary. RepoPact is deliberately narrower. It governs the load-bearing state that must
survive worker, session, machine, and provider changes if later work is expected to remain
inspectable and accountable.

The ecosystem's existing mechanisms each cover part of this problem. Repository
instruction files tell an agent how to behave. Agent-memory systems improve recall across
calls. Architecture decision records preserve decisions. CI and policy-as-code enforce
checks. Issue trackers preserve tasks. Sandboxes and authorization systems govern live
execution. These are useful and often necessary, but they usually do not combine project
intent, authority, evidence, lifecycle, provenance, conformance, and drift into one
repository-native contract.

RepoPact does not replace those systems. It gives them a durable governance layer to meet
in.

The practical distinction is still useful:

> `AGENTS.md` and similar instruction files tell an agent how it should behave. RepoPact
> records durable project state around that behavior and validates, and where enforceable
> can enforce, whether the repository still respects its declared contract.

This paper makes six contributions.

1. **A repository-native governance model.** RepoPact models durable project governance
   as typed records in the version-controlled tree, organized as a six-layer kernel, L0
   through L5.
2. **Governance continuity.** We define a worker handoff as successful when a fresh worker
   can recover the repository's represented governed state and current violations from the
   repository itself, without depending on the previous worker's private context.
3. **The binding invariant as a first-class primitive.** A binding invariant is a declared
   guarantee with rationale, escalation, and, where possible, machine enforcement. It is
   the unit a worker must not silently weaken.
4. **A typed enforcement lattice.** Invariants are classified by logical kind: state,
   state fixpoint, transition, temporal, relational, and meta. The kind predicts the
   required enforcer.
5. **A concrete-record brownfield trilemma and provenance-typed resolution.** When the
   obstacle is epistemic uncertainty, a concrete-only migration cannot always be total,
   faithful, and closed at once. Provenance-typed records let reconstructed state remain
   valid without pretending it is proven. Structurally contradictory source state can
   still remain explicit residue.
6. **A falsification-oriented evaluation program.** RepoPact is evaluated using the
   packaged product, a public Proving Ground, adversarial findings, a formal model, a
   machine-checkable conformance suite, naturalistic field observations, and
   pre-registered comparative benchmarks. Disconfirming results are in scope by design.

RepoPact is open source under Apache-2.0. The current stable public release is 3.1.0;
the implementation/evidence snapshot named above is the release-candidate source snapshot
used for this manuscript. It is part of the ForgeWire Labs inspectable-infrastructure
stack, but the system and model described here are independently useful.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Repository agent instructions

Repository context files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, and
editor-specific rule files provide project-local guidance to coding agents. `AGENTS.md` is
an open format stewarded through the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation
[1]. These files are useful because they travel with the code and can explain project
structure, test commands, conventions, and local expectations.

Their strength is also their boundary. They are instructions. By themselves they do not
provide typed work records, lifecycle semantics, evidence-gated completion, provenance,
conformance fixtures, or machine-enforced frozen surfaces. A context file can say, "Do not
weaken authentication." It cannot by itself prove that a work item preserved the
authentication invariant, reject completion without evidence, or distinguish a
reconstructed claim from a proven one.

RepoPact treats context files as input, not competition. During adoption, nested context
contracts can be registered and mapped into the repository's governance structure. Their
content remains available to agents. RepoPact adds typed authority, evidence, lifecycle,
and validation around them.

### 2.2 Agent memory and external state

Systems such as MemGPT extend an LLM beyond one context window by explicitly managing
multiple memory tiers and moving information between them [2]. Retrieval-augmented
systems, persistent scratchpads, vector stores, and later agent-memory frameworks address
related continuity problems.

For software engineering, however, external memory has a portability problem. It may not
be versioned with the code. It may not be reviewed in pull requests. It may not be
available to a different model or provider. It may not survive a machine change. It may
preserve facts while losing authority, acceptance criteria, provenance, or evidence.

RepoPact does not try to replace external memory. It asks a narrower question: which
project facts are important enough that the next legitimate worker should be able to
recover them from the artifact being changed? Those facts belong in the repository-native
governance layer.

### 2.3 Decision records and issue tracking

Architecture Decision Records are a well-established lightweight pattern for keeping
important technical decisions and their rationale close to the code. Nygard's original
form explicitly emphasizes helping future developers understand why a decision was made
rather than blindly accepting or reversing it [3]. RepoPact adopts that durability lesson
but gives decisions a larger governed context: work authority, invariants, evidence,
provenance, and lifecycle are linked rather than left as separate conventions.

Issue trackers remain effective at team-visible queues, comments, planning, and broad
product management. RepoPact does not attempt to replace every tracker feature. Its local
work ledger exists because implementation authority, dependencies, acceptance criteria,
provenance, and evidence are state that a cloned repository may need to carry even when an
external SaaS account or local agent session is unavailable.

### 2.4 Policy as code and runtime governance

Open Policy Agent is a general-purpose policy engine that separates policy decision-making
from the systems that enforce those decisions [4]. Conftest applies OPA's Rego language to
structured configuration and repository-oriented policy tests [5]. These systems are
strong examples of executable policy and compose naturally with RepoPact.

The distinction is one of unit and boundary. Runtime and policy engines ask whether an
action or configuration is allowed under a rule. RepoPact also records why a guarantee
exists, what work is authorized, what evidence closes that work, what provenance supports
a claim, and how the resulting state remains recoverable later.

Runtime agent-governance systems similarly focus on live execution: sandboxing, tool
authorization, policy gates, intent verification, audit logging, approval, network control,
and secret handling. RepoPact guards a different boundary. Runtime controls ask whether a
worker may perform an action now. RepoPact asks whether the durable project state that
results remains inspectable and conformant later. The two approaches should compose rather
than compete.

### 2.5 Architecture fitness functions and developer catalogs

Evolutionary-architecture work uses fitness functions to make architectural characteristics
observable and, where possible, automatically testable as systems change [6]. RepoPact's
typed invariant lattice shares the idea that some important qualities should be executable
constraints, but it widens the record around the constraint to include authority,
rationale, escalation, work, provenance, and evidence.

Developer portals and catalogs solve a related discoverability problem at organizational
scale. Backstage, for example, provides a centralized software catalog whose source
metadata can live alongside code and whose entities form a relationship graph [7].
RepoPact is narrower and more repository-local. Its primary unit is the governed repository
state rather than an organization-wide service catalog. This distinction becomes relevant
to future repository-orientation work: a graph can improve discovery without becoming the
source of truth it summarizes.

### 2.6 Software-agent evaluation

SWE-bench introduced a benchmark built from real GitHub issues and repositories, requiring
models to modify codebases rather than generate isolated snippets [8]. SWE-EVO extends the
evaluation problem toward long-horizon software evolution, with multi-step changes spanning
many files and release-level requirements [9]. These benchmarks motivate RepoPact's focus
on recovery, continuity, and long-running project state rather than single-turn generation.

RepoPact's own benchmark program does not claim that these external suites directly measure
governance. They are candidate task beds and comparison points for long-horizon behavior.
RepoPact-specific hypotheses are pre-registered separately in its research protocol.

## 3. Model

RepoPact is modeled as a layered governance kernel over a repository.

| Layer | Name | Object | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Record store | typed repository state `s` | stores governing source records |
| L1 | Lifecycle FSM | per-work-item automaton `M_w` | models work state and authority transitions |
| L2 | Invariant monitor | predicate `I`; language `R` | decides conformance |
| L3 | Enforcement lattice | typed invariants | maps invariant kind to an appropriate enforcer |
| L4 | Derive layer | projections `pi` | generates dashboards and specification views |
| L5 | Adoption boundary | migration and external state | brings previously ungoverned state into the pact |

L0 through L3 operate on state already represented in the repository. L4 derives
materialized views. L5 is the boundary where RepoPact encounters state it does not yet
contain, such as trackers, private documents, conversation history, and legacy planning
systems.

### 3.1 State, records, and provenance

A repository state is a finite typed record store:

```text
s = <ver, Inv, Frz, Own, Reg, C, W, E, D, P, A, Prov>
```

where:

| Symbol | Component | Typical source location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ver` | semantic version | `VERSION` |
| `Inv` | declared invariants | `governance/invariants.json` |
| `Frz` | frozen surfaces | `governance/frozen-surface.json` |
| `Own` | scopes, roles, concurrency rules | `governance/owners.json` |
| `Reg` | audit registry | `audits/registry.json` |
| `C` | contract files | registered root and nested contracts |
| `W` | work items | `work/<status>/<id-slug>/work-item.json` |
| `E` | evidence runs | `evidence/runs/<id>.json` |
| `D` | decisions | `decisions/<id-slug>.md` |
| `P` | policies | `governance/policies/<id-slug>.md` |
| `A` | audit findings | `audits/findings/<id-slug>.json` |
| `Prov` | provenance typing | record fields and validator semantics |

Each relevant record `r` has a provenance type:

```text
prov(r) in {concrete, provisional, inferred}
```

A **concrete** record asserts that its claim is directly authored or backed by concrete
evidence. A **provisional** record is valid but not complete. An **inferred** record is
reconstructed from available signals rather than directly proven.

The distinction is epistemic, not cosmetic. Validity does not require pretending every
known thing is fully proven. It requires that uncertainty be represented honestly.
Completion remains stricter: completed work must rest on the required concrete evidence.

A work item is modeled as:

```text
w = (id, title, status, owner, affected_scopes, dependencies, AC, created, updated, prov)
```

with:

```text
status(w) in {proposed, active, blocked, deferred, completed}
```

These are not merely progress labels. They encode authority.

* `proposed` captures candidate work without authorizing implementation.
* `active` records accepted work that is authorized to proceed.
* `blocked` records accepted work that cannot currently proceed.
* `deferred` records accepted work that has intentionally been postponed.
* `completed` records delivered work whose acceptance criteria are evidence-closed.

A criterion is:

```text
c = (criterion_id, status, evidence_links)
status(c) in {pending, satisfied, waived}
```

The work item's declared status and its lifecycle directory must agree. That agreement is
an invariant, not an assumption.

### 3.2 Governance continuity

Let the recoverable governance projection of repository state `s` be:

```text
G(s) = <Inv, Frz, Own, Reg, C, W, E, D, P, A, Prov>
```

Let `Viol(s)` be the current set of conformance violations. A worker handoff is
governance-continuous when a fresh legitimate worker, starting from a clean clone and the
versioned RepoPact semantics, can recover both the represented governed state and its known
violations without access to predecessor-private context:

```text
recover(clean_clone(s)) = <G(s), Viol(s)>
```

The equality is semantic rather than presentation-identical. A GUI and CLI may render the
same work differently while agreeing on authority, dependency, evidence, provenance, and
violations.

This is stronger than "the next agent can read the code" and weaker than "the repository
contains everything anyone knows." RepoPact does not claim omniscience. State that never
crosses L5 cannot be recovered from the repository.

Governance continuity also allows recovery of an invalid state. If a repository has
drifted, the next worker should see the drift rather than receive a falsely clean
reconstruction. This is why the recovery target includes `Viol(s)`.

H15 and S8 pre-register the empirical test of this property. They were added on 2026-09-12
before any S8 run.

### 3.3 Lifecycle automaton, L1

Per work item:

```text
M_w = (Q, Lambda, delta_w, Q0)
Q  = {proposed, active, blocked, deferred, completed}
Q0 = {proposed, active}
```

The `proposed -> active` transition is an authority event. It changes recorded intent into
accepted implementation work.

The transition relation is deliberately permissive. Work can be blocked, deferred,
reopened, or moved backward when reality changes. RepoPact prefers explicit degradation
over pretending progress is monotonic.

The completion edge is semantically guarded by:

```text
g_done(w, s) =
  every acceptance criterion is not pending
  and every satisfied criterion links evidence that exists
  and completed work is concrete
  and concrete completed work does not rest on non-concrete evidence
```

RepoPact does not require every filesystem edit to pass through a runtime gate. Humans and
agents can edit files directly. The checkpoint decides whether the resulting repository
state is admissible.

### 3.4 Invariant monitor, L2

The canonical validator computes a finite set of violations:

```text
Viol(s)
```

Define:

```text
I(s) iff Viol(s) = empty
R = {s | I(s)}
```

`R` is the recognized conformant repository language for a given version. A conformant
implementation accepts repositories in `R` and rejects the rest for the specified and
fixture-covered rules.

The predicate decomposes into checks including:

| Predicate | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `I_ver` | version is well formed |
| `I_struct` | records satisfy their schemas |
| `I_contract` | required contracts are present and registered |
| `I_id` | identifiers, paths, and lifecycle directories agree |
| `I_ref` | dependencies, evidence, owners, scopes, and decisions reference known records |
| `I_accept` | completion and satisfied criteria are evidence-closed |
| `I_acyclic` | work dependencies are acyclic |
| `I_conc` | disjoint-scope concurrency rules hold when enabled |
| `I_orphan` | planning content does not exist invisibly outside the ledger where enforced |
| `I_prov` | provenance is valid and completion does not rely on insufficient proof |
| `I_derive` | enforced generated artifacts match their canonical projection |
| `I_frozen` | protected changes receive required acknowledgement at diff time |

The edit trace may come from the CLI, Workbench, an agent, a human, or arbitrary filesystem
operations. RepoPact's claim is not that invalid edits cannot be made. Its claim is that
invalid governed states can be detected, rejected, and explained at the applicable
checkpoint.

### 3.5 Typed enforcement lattice, L3

Not all invariants are the same kind of proposition.

| Type | Example | Needed information | Typical enforcer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| state | completed implies no pending criterion | one tree | validator |
| state | satisfied implies linked evidence | one tree | validator |
| state with provenance | completed implies sufficient concrete proof | one tree | validator |
| state fixpoint | dashboard equals canonical projection | one tree plus generator | validator and generator |
| transition | frozen-surface change requires acknowledgement | base and head | diff-time checker |
| temporal | completed history is not rewritten to look cleaner | git trace | history analysis and review |
| relational | nested contract refines parent contract | contract pair and semantic order | review, future formalization |
| meta | critical state does not live only outside the pact | repository plus judgment | partial checks and human review |

This lattice prevents RepoPact from pretending one validator can prove everything. A schema
cannot enforce a historical property. A one-tree validator cannot know whether a protected
path changed relative to a base. Human judgment is still required for some semantic
relationships.

The goal is explicit enforcement boundaries, not fictional total automation.

### 3.6 Derive layer, L4

RepoPact separates source records from derived views. Source records include work items,
evidence, decisions, invariants, owner maps, policies, findings, and contract registrations.
Derived artifacts include dashboards and specification projections.

The principle is:

```text
derive over declare
```

Anything computable from source records should be generated rather than hand-maintained.
For example:

```text
pi_dashboard(s) -> audits/reports/dashboard.md
pi_spec(s)      -> SPEC.md derived blocks
```

Where enforced, a generated artifact is valid only when it matches its canonical
projection. This prevents a status page from quietly becoming a second source of truth.

A generated dashboard still does not prove that every human-authored record describes
external reality. It proves that the materialized view matches its source records.
Semantic truth remains a separate responsibility.

### 3.7 Adoption boundary, L5, and the concrete-record trilemma

Brownfield projects already have history, issue trackers, planning docs, nested context
files, CI workflows, CODEOWNERS, roadmaps, and implicit knowledge. Some state can be
reconstructed from the repository. Some cannot.

For a reachable legacy claim whose uncertainty is **epistemic**, migration faces three
goals:

1. **Totality.** It should process the reachable signal.
2. **Faithfulness.** It should preserve what was observed without inventing proof.
3. **Closure.** The emitted representation should lie in the conformant language.

If every reconstructed claim must be concrete, those goals cannot always hold together. A
legacy roadmap may say a task is complete but contain no evidence. A historical decision
may be recoverable from context without a direct contemporaneous proof. Forcing those
claims to be concrete requires either invention, omission, or invalid output.

This is the **concrete-record adoption trilemma**:

```text
total + faithful + closed cannot always hold
when every reconstructed claim must be concrete
```

Provenance typing changes the target language. A reconstructed claim can be `inferred` or
`provisional`, preserving what was observed without pretending it was proven.

This resolves the **epistemic** form of the trilemma. It does not imply that every
arbitrary legacy tree can be mapped losslessly into a conformant state. Structural
contradictions such as cycles, unsupported relationships, impossible identifiers, or
references that cannot be mapped without changing their meaning can still leave explicit
migration residue.

The sound migration rule is therefore:

> Type uncertainty honestly, and report structural residue rather than hiding it.

### 3.8 Action taxonomy

| Class | Examples | Intended property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constructor | `init` | creates a valid governed repository from a supported clean target |
| typed mutation | create, edit, transition | plans bounded semantic changes and validates the result |
| derive/read | `validate`, `dashboard`, `spec`, analysis | observes or regenerates projections without inventing source intent |
| repair | `doctor --fix` | conservative repair toward conformance |
| migration | `adopt`, `import-plan` | crosses L5, using provenance where uncertainty is reconstructive |
| diff-time enforcement | `check-frozen --base` | evaluates two-state protected-surface rules |

`doctor` is intended as a conservative repair and ratchet operator. It should reduce known
violations, leave healthy supported state unchanged, and avoid overwriting differing source
intent merely to make validation green.

## 4. Reference Implementation

The current RepoPact release line is no longer accurately described as only a Python CLI.
The architecture has evolved while preserving one important rule: there should be **one
semantic authority** for the governance model.

The current stable public release is 3.1.0. The release-candidate implementation snapshot
at `6d782116fc9762da00439cf079d0f50585fea52` includes a canonical Rust semantic engine, a
compatibility-oriented Python command surface, local-first verification and release
operations, a Tauri 2 Workbench, schemas, templates, a conformance suite, migration tools,
evidence records, and the research corpus. The stable Python/Rust artifact includes the
engine and CLI surfaces; Workbench installers/APKs follow their own platform release path
and are not silently implied by the PyPI artifact. The snapshot also contains substantially
implemented but still active ROG and mobile work; those incomplete criteria remain explicit
below rather than being promoted to completed product or empirical claims.

The manuscript uses four evidence levels. **Stable product** means the Python/Rust 3.1.0
package and its documented CLI/conformance boundary. **Implemented but incomplete/active**
means code and concrete checkpoints exist while the governing work item still has open
criteria, as with WI063 and WI065. **Research infrastructure** means preregistered studies,
harnesses, instrumentation, and RealRunner execution plumbing. **Empirical results** means
only completed, reportable observations; architecture, smoke plumbing, and preregistered
plans are not substituted for comparative results.

### 4.1 Canonical Rust semantic engine

Recent implementation work moved proven semantic surfaces into a reusable Rust core rather
than creating separate implementations for every client.

The canonical Rust surfaces include repository discovery and modeling, schema-backed
validation, structured diagnostics, dashboard rendering, relationship graphs,
deterministic analysis, typed work-item creation, typed work-item editing for proven
fields, lifecycle transition, and content-addressed mutation planning and recovery.

The design goal is not "all code must be Rust." It is "one semantic engine." Historical or
migration-oriented operations may still live in Python when they have not been moved or
proven in Rust, but final repository-validity decisions should converge on the canonical
semantic authority rather than allow two implementations to drift silently.

For compatibility, Python can act as a local client to the Rust engine using a versioned
process protocol. Native clients such as the Tauri Workbench can call the same Rust crates
directly.

Conceptually:

```text
human / agent / automation
          |
          +-------------------------+
          |                         |
          v                         v
Python compatibility CLI       Tauri Workbench
          |                         |
          v                         |
versioned local protocol            |
          |                         |
          +------------+------------+
                       v
              canonical Rust engine
                       |
                       v
repository model, validation, graph,
analysis, mutation, projection
```

This architecture matters for governance continuity. The UI and agent-facing tooling are
different interaction surfaces over the same governed state, not separate products with
different semantics.

### 4.2 CLI surface

The public command surface includes operations such as:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | seed a valid RepoPact into a new repository |
| `adopt` | map existing repository signals into RepoPact records |
| `import-plan` | import legacy planning material |
| `new` | create preflight work items |
| `validate` | check structural and semantic conformance |
| `dashboard` | generate dashboard views from source records |
| `spec` | generate or check specification projections |
| `check-frozen` | enforce frozen-surface changes against a base |
| `doctor` | diagnose, repair, and migrate drift |

The stable 3.1.0 package exposes newer operational surfaces, including `verify ci`, grouped
`release` verification/build/inspect commands, graph operations, assurance snapshots, and
the bounded admission/approval surfaces. These are additive to the earlier CLI. The package
surface does not imply that every external release, platform, or research gate has closed.

Mandatory preflight makes intent visible before implementation begins. Existing repositories
use migration and grandfathering semantics rather than pretending historical work was
preflighted when it was not.

### 4.3 Human operator surface

RepoPact Workbench is a Tauri 2 application that exposes repository governance to a human
operator without creating a second source of truth.

The Workbench is not a generic Markdown editor. It is a typed client of the canonical
engine. It presents repository state, validation, work lifecycle, decisions, evidence,
relationships, analysis, session state, and governed mutations through user-facing views.

This is important because inspectability is not complete if only agents have practical
access to the governance controls. Human operators must be able to inspect the same state
and exercise the same core authority without needing to ask an agent to mutate repository
records on their behalf.

The release standard for the Workbench is therefore **operator control parity for core
governance**, not pixel-perfect identity with the CLI. A human should be able to inspect,
create, edit, and transition governed work using the same semantic engine that an agent or
automation path uses.

### 4.4 Cross-platform posture

The Workbench shares one Tauri 2 application architecture across desktop and mobile targets.
Current evidence includes Windows installer/application work, Linux `.deb` build-install-
launch validation, and a real Android SAF acquisition checkpoint on an emulator. The mobile
path proved directory and archive import, app-private staging, registry persistence,
picker cancellation, and permission/log-privacy checks, while mid-import cancellation,
Workbench mutation, and explicit export/share-back remain open in WI065.

macOS and iOS remain intended targets and share application and asset foundations, but they
should not be described as validated until native platform evidence exists.

The cross-platform point is not a marketing checkbox. Governance continuity is more
credible when durable project state can be inspected from different environments without
moving authority into one machine-specific local database.

### 4.5 Validation and conformance

Validation has two broad layers. JSON Schema validates individual record structure.
Semantic validation checks cross-record rules such as referential integrity,
status-directory agreement, dependency cycles, evidence links, scope validity,
concurrency, provenance, orphan planning content, and derived-artifact consistency.

A standard without conformance is only a convention. RepoPact therefore publishes a
versioned 3.1.0 conformance surface including `CONFORMANCE.md`, fixture repositories, a
suite manifest, and a conformance runner. The current canonical run passes 35/35 fixture
cases and the additive WI050 admission corpus passes 8/8 vectors.

A third-party implementation does not need to copy RepoPact's internal code to claim
compatibility. It needs to reproduce the specified accept/reject behavior for the versioned
conformance surface.

This separates four claims that are easy to blur:

1. the paper's formal model,
2. the repository contract,
3. the machine-checkable conformance corpus,
4. the evidence produced by concrete runs.

### 4.6 Proving Ground split

RepoPact defines the governance model, validator semantics, conformance expectations, and
research protocols. Runnable adversarial experiments live separately in **RepoPact Proving
Ground**.

```text
RepoPact defines the pact.
RepoPact Proving Ground tests whether the pact holds under pressure.
```

The Proving Ground consumes released RepoPact artifacts rather than depending only on the
author's source checkout. That distinction matters because an adopter receives a packaged
product, not the development tree.

## 5. Evaluation Method

The evaluation has two parts. The first is reflexive and adversarial. It asks whether
RepoPact catches the failure classes it claims to catch and whether real adoption exposes
contradictions in the model. The second is comparative. It asks whether RepoPact changes
outcomes relative to a fair baseline when model, task, source, and harness are held
constant.

### 5.1 Reflexive adversarial falsification

The reflexive protocol defines hypotheses H1 through H7 and falsification criteria before
the relevant runs. The subject under test is the packaged product, not merely the local
source tree.

| Hypothesis | Claim |
| --- | --- |
| H1 | an adopter can install the package and reach a valid governed repository |
| H2 | advertised commands are closed over the initialized repository surface |
| H3 | completion is evidence-gated |
| H4 | frozen-surface and invariant authority are binding |
| H5 | state-integrity violations are rejected |
| H6 | a reader can recover represented project state from the tree alone |
| H7 | brownfield adoption is non-destructive, sound, and honest about uncertainty/residue |

A documented command crashing, a validator accepting unproven completion, a protected
surface changing without acknowledgement, status-directory mismatch passing validation,
or represented project recovery requiring missing chat history are evidence against the
relevant claim rather than cosmetic defects.

Every defect is fed back through RepoPact's own machinery: finding, work item, decision,
evidence, and validation. This is itself a test of recoverability.

### 5.2 Comparative benchmark program

The comparative program holds source, task, model, and harness constant while varying the
registered governance or context condition.

| Study | Hypothesis | Construct | Primary outputs | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | H8 | guarantee-violation detection, PactBench | catch/escalate rate, false-stop rate, confusion matrix | runnable infrastructure present; real results pending |
| S2 | H9 | cross-session recovery and efficiency | resolution rate, recovery score, tokens, interventions | protocol defined |
| S3 | H10 | multi-agent coordination | conflict rate, duplicated work, joint success | protocol defined |
| S4 | H11 | context-token economy | cost-success frontier, scaling curve | protocol defined |
| S5 | H12 | drift detection and staleness | detection rate, latency, silent-staleness rate | drift harness present; comparative results pending |
| S6 | H13 | defensive security and injection resistance | defensive catch rate, injected-context-followed rate | tasks scoped; real results pending |
| S7 | H14 | enforcement closure and longitudinal drift | checkpoint coverage, invocation, effectiveness, nonconformant admission | pre-registered 2026-08-21; not completed |
| S8 | H15 | governance continuity and clean-clone orientation | governance recovery, violation recall, false-clean rate, orientation cost | pre-registered 2026-09-12; R1 graph-enabled evaluation not run |

The current benchmark maturity should be described precisely. The program is
pre-registered and partially implemented: deterministic task materialization, the driver,
scoring, drift/security instrumentation, and harness infrastructure exist. WI022 AC-5 has
also crossed the real-model-exercised boundary through a reportable three-task RealRunner
smoke with reconciled telemetry and deterministic grading. That smoke validates the runtime
and evidence path; it is not a comparative result, Pareto frontier, scaling curve, or claim
that one model or governance condition is better. WI022 AC-3 remains pending because the
two-model-family comparative program has not been completed.

S8 is intentionally distinct from S2. S2 asks whether durable state improves downstream
task recovery. S8 asks whether the represented governed substrate itself survives a change
of worker, machine, or supported client without hidden predecessor-local authority. Its
secondary cost metrics include time, tokens, tool calls, file reads, bytes read, and
repository-wide search or grep operations. Those search-cost metrics were registered before
design of any future repository-orientation graph.

### 5.3 PactBench

PactBench measures whether agents silently weaken declared guarantees less often when
RepoPact governance is present.

The core task shape is:

1. A repository contains a declared guarantee.
2. A task creates pressure to take a shortcut.
3. The shortcut would violate the guarantee.
4. Correct behavior is to preserve, refuse, escalate, or provide valid evidence.
5. The scorer records silent weakening, correct preservation, escalation, or false stopping.

The suite includes correctness and security classes, evidence-fabrication pressure,
context-injection cases, real fixtures, a model-agnostic harness, deterministic pipeline
selftests, a subprocess interface for real agents, and drift experiments.

## 6. Results to Date

The reflexive findings register currently contains nineteen entries. Severity reflects
impact on an adopter rather than implementation effort. "Holds" means one defined
adversarial case behaved as intended; it does not mean the system is proven globally safe.

| ID | Hypothesis | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-001 | H2 | major | `spec` crashed on an `init`-fresh repository | fixed and re-verified |
| F-002 | H4 | minor | `check-frozen` was blind to working-tree edits | fixed and re-verified |
| F-003 | H3 | holds | satisfied criterion without evidence rejected | n/a |
| F-004 | H5 | holds | status-directory mismatch rejected | n/a |
| F-005 | H4 | holds | protected committed change required acknowledgement | n/a |
| F-006 | H1, H6 | holds | full work item recovered from tree alone | n/a |
| F-007 | H7 | holds* | real progenitor brownfield adoption was non-destructive | confirmatory only |
| F-008 | H7 | major | adopter `.gitignore` swallowed governance evidence | fixed with warning and repair guidance |
| F-009 | H7 | holds | clean-room adoption of an unrelated OSS repository reached conformance | n/a |
| F-010 | H7 | major | adoption left the real planning ledger outside RepoPact | fixed with `import-plan` |
| F-011 | H7 | major | an older adopter drifted invalid as the standard evolved | fixed with `doctor` path |
| F-012 | H7 | holds | full lifecycle worked on a different-domain application | shipped |
| F-013 | H7 | holds | governance-folder planning migrated without data loss | shipped |
| F-014 | H6, H7 | holds | downstream adoption exposed a missing authority state and the full resolution trace remained recoverable | shipped |
| F-015 | H7 | major | linked-worktree validation produced false errors | fixed in 3.0.2 and re-verified |
| F-016 | H6, H12 | minor | README and canonical JSON identity drifted | open; canonical-source reconciliation remains required |
| F-017 | H12 | minor | doctor documentation pointed at a stale source-of-truth path | fixed and re-verified |
| F-018 | H6, H7 | major | evidence chronology depended on drifting wall-clock timestamps | fixed with deterministic Git-recording basis |
| F-019 | H14 | major | mandatory preflight and post-change validation did not mechanically prevent an autonomous worker's first runtime write before admission | architecture accepted in WI050/decision 0038; executable guard and cross-platform proof pending |

### 6.1 Failures that changed the design

**F-001, surface closure.** A documented command crashed on an `init`-fresh repository
because it expected a specification file bootstrap had not created. This contradicted H2.
The command was corrected and the behavior re-verified from a rebuilt package.

**F-002, working-tree protection gap.** The frozen-surface checker originally evaluated
committed ranges but could miss an uncommitted local edit. That weakened the practical
meaning of local preflight. The checker was changed so protected working-tree edits are
visible before commit.

**F-008, the swallowed record.** A brownfield repository's existing `.gitignore` rule
matched `evidence/runs/`. The repository could validate on the author's disk while a clean
clone lost the ignored evidence. Adoption now checks whether generated records are ignored
and surfaces actionable warnings.

**F-010, the hollow ledger.** Adoption could produce a structurally valid RepoPact tree
while the team's real planning still lived in a legacy plan directory. The result was
formally governed but practically misleading. This motivated `import-plan`, which brings
legacy planning into the governed work ledger without inventing evidence.

**F-011, longitudinal drift.** An older adopter fell out of conformance as the standard
evolved. Validation could detect the problem when invoked, but the adopter had no guided
repair path. This motivated `doctor` as an upgrade and repair mechanism.

**F-015, linked-worktree false errors.** Validation of repositories opened through linked
worktrees produced false errors because the physical checkout topology was not handled
deterministically. The implementation was corrected and re-verified in the stable 3.0.2
line; the case remains in the register because it changed the release evidence boundary.

**F-016, identity drift.** A README identity statement and canonical JSON records diverged.
This is an open documentation/source-of-truth reconciliation item rather than evidence that
the semantic engine accepted an invalid record. Canonical metadata remains authoritative.

**F-017, doctor source-of-truth drift.** The repair-path documentation referenced a stale
source-of-truth location. The documentation and its validation path were corrected and
re-verified.

**F-018, chronology drift.** Evidence ordering that relied on wall-clock timestamps could
drift across machines and time settings. Evidence chronology now uses a deterministic
Git-recording basis so the ordering claim is reproducible rather than merely plausible.

**F-019, admission boundary.** A later field case exposed a stronger boundary than
enforcement closure alone. RepoPact could durably require preflight and detect an invalid
sequence after the fact while still lacking a mechanism that prevented an autonomous
worker's first write before admission. This became F-019 and motivated WI050. The result
narrows the claim: repository governance and post-change verification are not equivalent to
pre-execution containment. Protected admission requires a distinct runtime or OS-backed
enforcement boundary.

These failures matter because they show that evaluation can change the architecture. They
were not edited out of the story once fixed.

### 6.2 What held

Several adversarial cases behaved as intended. A satisfied criterion without evidence was
rejected. Status-directory mismatch was rejected. Protected changes required
acknowledgement. A reader could reconstruct work intent, decision context, and proof from
the tree without relying on chat history.

These are bounded results. They support the tested mechanisms for the tested cases. They do
not prove there is no bypass.

### 6.3 Brownfield adoption and provenance

Brownfield adoption has been exercised against projects with different levels of
independence and complexity. The progenitor repository is useful but confirmatory because
RepoPact was distilled from practices it already used. An unrelated open-source repository
provided a cleaner sparse-signal adoption case. Different-domain applications exercised
adoption, planning import, repair, and lifecycle behavior.

The theoretical shift came from realizing that brownfield reconstruction should not force
uncertain state to masquerade as fact. Provenance typing allows the repository to preserve
useful reconstructed state while keeping completion strict.

That result must be kept narrow. Provenance solves uncertainty about *how strongly a
reachable claim is known*. It does not make a cyclic dependency graph acyclic or turn an
unsupported relationship into a valid one. Structural residue must still be reported.

This distinction is useful for agents. A system that accepts only "known" or "missing"
invites fabrication under pressure. A system with explicit `inferred` and `provisional`
types gives a worker an honest third option.

### 6.4 Authority typing under adoption pressure

The `proposed` lifecycle state was introduced because real usage exposed a missing
authority type. Candidate work deserved durable capture but was not yet accepted for
implementation.

Without `proposed`, every available mapping was dishonest in a different way. `active`
granted authority too early. `blocked` implied an external impediment. `deferred` implied
prior acceptance.

The system grew a type rather than tolerating ambiguity. This mirrors the provenance
lesson. Provenance types prevent a record from claiming more certainty than it has. The
`proposed` state prevents a work item from claiming more authority than it has.

### 6.5 Enforcement closure field case

A naturalistic field observation in ForgeWire exposed another boundary. RepoPact validation
had accumulated a substantial reported error count while the project's ordinary tests
stayed green because the governance validator was not consistently invoked in the workflow
path that mattered.

The raw count was not itself a clean measure of governance drift. Investigation showed
that a significant portion came from a version-specific validator defect involving local
worktree scanning, while the remainder were confirmed governance discrepancies. The two
classes are preserved separately rather than combined into one dramatic number.

The case supports narrower conclusions. When invoked, RepoPact detected governance
discrepancies that ordinary project tests did not reveal. Adoption plus a correct validator
does not guarantee that the validator is exercised at the boundaries where admission
happens. Deployment therefore needs checkpoint coverage, checkpoint invocation, and
checkpoint effectiveness.

These properties motivate **enforcement closure** and H14. The field observation motivated
the hypothesis. It does not confirm it. A later F-019 case provides negative evidence against
equating local preflight/post-change validation with protected admission: the repository can
record and detect an invalid sequence without preventing the first autonomous runtime write.
S7 remains the prospective test, and protected admission remains incomplete. Local
verification success is not remote enforcement closure.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 The repository as the common governed substrate

RepoPact's strongest practical property is not that it stores more files. It is that the
same durable state is available to different legitimate workers.

A human can inspect a work item in the Workbench. An agent can inspect the same work item
from the tree. Automation can validate the same acceptance criteria. A clean clone can
reconstruct the same decision and evidence links. None of those clients should need a
private hidden database to understand what the project believes is true.

That is the core of governance continuity.

The repository becomes the meeting point between humans and agents because it survives
both sides. Humans change jobs, machines fail, models change, subscriptions change,
sessions expire, and context windows reset. The repository remains.

### 7.2 Human operator control is part of inspectability

A governance system is incomplete if humans can technically inspect the files but must ask
an agent to perform ordinary governance actions for them.

RepoPact Workbench is therefore not just presentation polish. It is the human operator
surface of the same semantic system. Creating, editing, transitioning, validating, and
understanding governed work must be available to humans without weakening the model or
creating a separate UI-owned truth.

This is why UI parity is a release concern. A missing control is not always cosmetic if the
missing action forces the human operator to leave the governed interaction model or
delegate authority merely to compensate for an incomplete client.

Parity should still be defined semantically. The Workbench does not need to reproduce every
CLI command literally. It needs to expose the core governance capabilities a human
operator requires while preserving the same underlying authority and validation rules.

### 7.3 Why repository-native governance

Repository-native governance creates ceremony. The claim is not that ceremony is free or
appropriate everywhere.

It is most justified when multiple humans or agents will touch the same work, guarantees
must survive context loss, authority boundaries matter, completion must be evidence-backed,
uncertainty must be represented honestly, and future workers must be able to recover state
from the repository alone.

For a throwaway script or low-risk experiment, this may be unnecessary. For long-lived
agentic engineering, the cost-benefit calculation changes because high-speed workers can
also create high-speed drift.

### 7.4 Enforcement without pretending total automation

RepoPact does not claim every invariant can be fully automated. The typed enforcement
lattice is partly a restraint mechanism.

Some rules are decidable from one tree. Some require a diff. Some require history. Some
still require human judgment. The system should say which category a guarantee belongs to
rather than imply that a schema somehow proves semantic intent.

The benefit is not perfect automation. It is explicit enforcement boundaries and durable
evidence about what was actually checked.

### 7.5 Provenance and authority are both type problems

Two of RepoPact's most useful changes came from refusing to force messy reality into
dishonest binary states.

Provenance typing says a reconstructed fact can be useful without being concrete proof.
The proposed lifecycle state says captured work can be useful without being implementation
authority.

Both changes follow the same rule: when the system repeatedly has to lie to fit reality
into the schema, the schema is missing a type.

### 7.6 The L5 boundary remains real

RepoPact only governs what crosses into the repository. It cannot recover a decision that
was never written down, a private conversation it never received, or intent that exists
only in someone's head.

This limitation should remain explicit. Governance continuity is a property of represented
state, not omniscience.

Future integrations with trackers, design systems, and external planning sources should
therefore preserve provenance and authority rather than pretending ingestion turns every
external statement into fact.

### 7.7 Relationship to runtime governance

RepoPact is not a sandbox, authorization server, agent firewall, or distributed execution
system.

A secure agentic engineering stack likely needs both runtime and repository governance.
Runtime controls limit what can happen now. Repository governance limits what can be
accepted as durable project state later.

The distinction is useful because the two failure modes are different. A runtime may safely
execute a command that still produces a governance-invalid change. A repository may remain
perfectly conformant while a live tool call violates a runtime security boundary. One
system should not pretend to replace the other.

### 7.8 Orientation cost and the next repository-native problem

Governance continuity says the state is recoverable. It does not say a fresh worker can
recover it cheaply.

A large repository can be perfectly durable while still forcing every new agent to burn
context and time rediscovering its structure through repeated file listing, grep, search,
and ad hoc traversal. That is an efficiency problem adjacent to, but distinct from,
governance continuity.

S8 therefore records orientation cost separately from correctness, including tokens, tool
calls, file reads, bytes read, and repository-wide search operations. Those measures were
registered before design of any future orientation mechanism.

A durable Repository Orientation Graph is now substantially implemented and operational
rather than merely future work. WI063 has 37 of 40 criteria satisfied. The current
implementation includes durable and deterministic graph representation, incremental/full
convergence, working-tree overlays, freshness/capability states, Rust/Python/JavaScript/
TypeScript semantic extraction, TOML/JSON/YAML/Markdown metadata adapters,
build/package/test/runtime topology, clean-clone operation, adoption/backfill integration,
bounded public query/orientation operations, deterministic pagination and bounds, Workbench
repository-map behavior, branch/merge graph regeneration, performance/storage measurements,
and authority-boundary tests.

The graph remains non-authoritative: source and governance records remain the source of
truth, and graph output does not authorize mutation. Three WI063 criteria remain open:
cross-form-factor/platform usability and normalization, execution of the preregistered S8
R1 graph-enabled evaluation, and the final closeout inventory/gate. Any graph-enabled
condition must be added through a dated amendment and measured against the pre-registered
no-graph baseline rather than assumed valuable from architectural appeal. The available
implementation evidence therefore supports operational maturity, not a causal claim that
ROG improves orientation or complete repository understanding.

### 7.9 Assurance and control mapping

WI051 is completed with an optional, provider-neutral assurance/control mapping model. A
mapping can distinguish framework mapping, applicability conclusion, implemented control,
operating evidence, and independent audit or certification, while resolving implementation
and evidence references, recording reviewer rationale, detecting stale framework/review and
reference drift, and guarding sensitive evidence and documentation claim basis. ForgeWire is
represented as an adopter example rather than a hard-coded framework.

This capability governs the boundaries and evidence of assurance claims; it does not infer
legal compliance, certification, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, or any other external conclusion
from a stored mapping. The records are optional, so their absence does not invalidate an
existing 3.0.2 repository.

## 8. Threats to Validity

### T1: Reflexivity

RepoPact was distilled from the author's own agentic engineering practices. That gives it
practical relevance but threatens generality. ForgeWire, the progenitor adopter, is
confirmatory rather than independent. RepoPact's own repository is also ForgeWire Labs
controlled.

Unrelated repositories, different domains, outside operators, and third-party reproduction
are necessary before broad generality claims are warranted.

### T2: Single evaluator and operator effects

Much of the early evidence comes from one primary human operator working with several AI
systems. The process may reflect that operator's habits, technical judgment, model choices,
and tolerance for governance ceremony.

Exact commands, public artifacts, evidence records, and falsification criteria improve
inspectability but do not remove this threat.

### T3: Scale and domain narrowness

Current evidence is not representative of every enterprise, regulated environment,
monorepo, or many-agent team. Some adoption subjects are substantial, but
organization-scale claims require broader evidence.

### T4: Holds are not proofs

Catching one adversarial case proves only that the tested case was caught under the tested
conditions. It does not establish universal safety.

### T5: Benchmark curation

PactBench could overfit to RepoPact's strengths. Pre-registration, fair baselines, frozen
task identities, and publication of disconfirming results are necessary mitigations.

### T6: Baseline fairness

A deliberately weak baseline would exaggerate RepoPact's value. Comparative studies should
include realistic convention files and, where appropriate, external-memory or retrieval
support. Governance ceremony must count as cost.

### T7: Token and cost measurement

Token-economy claims depend on model, tokenizer, provider pricing, caching, prompt
construction, and retrieval behavior. Raw and adjusted measurements should be reported
rather than reduced to one headline number.

### T8: Drift and security realism

Synthetic drift and defensive-security tasks may not reflect real projects. Security work
must remain benign and sandboxed. RepoPact's own records must also be treated as an attack
surface.

### T9: Provenance misuse

If users treat `inferred` or `provisional` records as equivalent to concrete proof,
provenance typing loses its value. Completion restrictions and UI visibility are therefore
part of the model, not merely presentation.

### T10: Standard and implementation coupling

The canonical implementation currently defines a large part of the operational semantics.
The conformance suite mitigates this by giving alternate implementations an observable
target, but the standard must continue to resist accidental dependence on private
implementation details.

### T11: Workbench maturity

The existence of a polished-looking UI can create a false impression that every governance
capability has reached operator parity. UI claims must distinguish between implemented,
wired, validated, and merely planned controls. The mobile acquisition implementation has
crossed a real Android SAF import/build boundary, but mutation, explicit export/share-back,
and full end-to-end runtime acceptance remain active. Missing operator controls should
remain visible as release work rather than being hidden by overall visual quality.

### T12: Orientation mechanism bias

The active Repository Orientation Graph could be designed around the same tasks later used
to evaluate it. S8 reduces this risk by registering correctness and orientation-cost
measures before graph design and by requiring any graph-enabled condition to be added through
a new dated amendment before graph-condition runs. The graph remains a derived view, not a
replacement for source records.

## 9. Conclusion and Future Work

Agentic software engineering does not only have a context problem. It has a continuity
problem.

Code can survive a session while the governing state around that code disappears. The next
worker may receive the files but not the intent, authority, evidence, decisions, provenance,
or invariants that made the previous work legitimate.

RepoPact addresses that problem by making the version-controlled repository carry a typed
governance layer. A fresh human or agent can clone the project and recover not only source
code, but the represented governed state needed to understand what work exists, what is
authorized, what must not be weakened, what has been proven, what remains uncertain, and
what currently violates the pact.

This paper calls that property **governance continuity**.

RepoPact models the repository as a six-layer governance kernel with typed records,
lifecycle authority, invariant monitoring, a typed enforcement lattice, derived views, and
an adoption boundary. Its central primitive is the binding invariant. Its provenance types
let reconstructed state remain useful without pretending to be proven. Its lifecycle types
let candidate work remain visible without pretending to be authorized.

The implementation has also moved toward the architectural implication of the model: one
semantic authority, multiple legitimate interaction surfaces. The canonical Rust engine
supports agent, CLI, automation, and Tauri Workbench clients without requiring each client
to invent its own governance semantics. Human operator control and agent interoperability
therefore become two views of the same repository state rather than separate systems.

The evaluation so far is intentionally incomplete. Real failures have changed the design.
Real cases have held. RealRunner now proves that the model-execution and telemetry path can
be exercised, but it does not supply comparative results. The enforcement-closure field
observation motivated a new hypothesis rather than being retroactively treated as proof.
Governance continuity and graph-enabled orientation remain registered prospectively as
H15/S8, with no R1 run yet completed.

Future work includes:

1. completing real PactBench runs across multiple model families;
2. completing comparative drift, recovery, coordination, security, and token-economy studies;
3. running the pre-registered enforcement-closure study outside ForgeWire Labs controlled repositories;
4. running the pre-registered S8 governance-continuity study across clean worker, machine, and client handoffs;
5. obtaining genuine third-party reproduction and adoption evidence;
6. completing WI063's cross-platform usability/normalization, R1 execution, and closeout
   inventory;
7. completing WI065's Workbench mutation, explicit export/share-back, and end-to-end mobile
   runtime acceptance;
8. maintaining operator-control parity as repository-orientation, verification, and
   admission capabilities are added, and validating equivalent native behavior on macOS and
   iOS;
9. expanding external ingestion while preserving provenance and authority;
10. mechanizing more temporal and relational invariants and hardening repair semantics;
11. encouraging independent conformance implementations.

The repository is already the artifact software engineering expects every worker to share.
RepoPact's claim is that the same artifact can also carry the durable governance needed for
humans and agents to continue each other's work without starting over.

## Ethics and Responsible Disclosure

The security portions of the evaluation are defensive and benign by design. Tasks are
synthetic or sandboxed. They involve no live targets, credential theft, exploit deployment,
or instructions for real-world compromise.

Security-invariant tasks focus on whether agents preserve defensive controls such as
authorization checks, secret handling, input validation, evidence integrity, and protected
surfaces.

Injection tasks treat both convention files and RepoPact records as potentially hostile
text surfaces. RepoPact makes no immunity claim. Its defenses are structural: provenance,
frozen surfaces, evidence validation, explicit escalation, and reviewable records.

Defects should be recorded openly rather than quietly patched out of the evaluation
history. Agent runs should respect model-provider terms and preserve raw captures without
exposing secrets.

## Data and Artifact Availability

RepoPact is open source under Apache-2.0. The formal model, experiment protocol, benchmark
protocol, threats register, findings register, current paper, conformance suite, and related
research records live in the public RepoPact repository.

RepoPact Proving Ground hosts runnable benchmark artifacts including PactBench tasks,
fixtures, harnesses, deterministic pipeline selftests, subprocess real-runner support,
drift experiments, and future result bundles.

Benchmark corrections should be issued as new task ids or dated amendments rather than
silent edits. Real model result bundles should identify model, harness version, task-set
version, condition, prompts or command interface, raw captures where safe, scorer outputs,
and evidence links.

The conformance suite is versioned with RepoPact so the standard's observable semantics
remain independently testable.

### Appendix B: Governance continuity sketch

Let `s` be a repository state, `G(s)` its represented governance projection, and `Viol(s)`
its current known violations.

A worker transition `h` is governance-continuous for represented state when a fresh
legitimate worker can obtain a clean clone and recover:

```text
recover_h(clean_clone(s)) = <G(s), Viol(s)>
```

without requiring private predecessor context.

This is a recoverability claim, not an omniscience claim. Facts that never entered the
repository remain outside the model. A nonconformant repository may still satisfy
governance continuity if the next worker faithfully recovers both its governed records and
the violations that make the state nonconformant.

The practical falsification target is any load-bearing state that is required to continue
legitimate work but exists only in a specific worker, machine, provider, UI cache, or
conversation when the system claims the repository is authoritative for that state.

### Appendix C: Formal theorem sketch

Each claim is tagged by discharge status: **[def]** true by definition for the canonical
implementation, **[ci]** machine-checked on ordinary validation paths, **[fix]** covered by
the conformance corpus, **[structural]** an argument about the record language, and
**[conj]** a conjecture or standing falsification target.

**T1: Recognizer definition. [def]/[fix]**  
For a given version, the canonical validator recognizes the specified repository language.
Alternate implementations are tested through conformance fixtures rather than code identity.

**T2: Constructor correctness. [ci]**  
`init` should create a valid governed repository from a supported clean target.

**T3: Surface closure. [conj]**  
Advertised commands should either succeed or fail cleanly on the initialized surface
without corrupting state. F-001 was an original counterexample.

**T4: Completion safety. [fix]/[conj]**  
A completed item with pending criteria, missing evidence, or insufficient proof is not
conformant.

**T5: Checkpoint decision correctness. [ci]/[conj]**  
Where a checkpoint executes, its decision should match the enforced conformance language.
H14 exists because deployment must separately establish coverage, invocation, and
effectiveness.

**T6a: Concrete-record adoption trilemma. [structural]**  
For epistemically uncertain reachable claims, a migration that requires every emitted
claim to be concrete cannot always be total, faithful, and closed simultaneously.

**T6b: Provenance-typed epistemic closure. [ci]/[conj]**  
Where uncertainty of proof is the obstacle, a provenance-aware migration can preserve a
reconstructed claim as inferred or provisional while keeping completion gated on concrete
evidence. This does not claim that arbitrary structural contradictions are automatically
closed.

**T7: Repair monotonicity. [conj]**  
`doctor` should reduce known violations without silently replacing differing source intent
and should leave already healthy supported state unchanged.

**T8: Governance continuity for represented state. [conj]/[empirical]**  
A clean worker or supported-client transition should preserve recoverability of the
repository's represented governance projection and current violations without
predecessor-private context. H15/S8 is pre-registered to test this more broadly.
