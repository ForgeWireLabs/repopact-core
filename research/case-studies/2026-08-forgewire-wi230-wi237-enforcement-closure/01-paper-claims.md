# 01 — Paper Claims Inventory (Phase 2)

Source: `C:\\local-path-redacted, formal-model.md, protocol.md,
benchmark-protocol.md, findings.md, threats-to-validity.md,
gap-audit-2026-07.md}`, read in full. No claim below is reinterpreted to fit
the ForgeWire incident; that comparison happens in `05-claim-evidence-matrix.md`.

Format per claim: id, paraphrase, source, what would support it, what would
falsify/narrow it, required preconditions.

## C1 — The lifecycle/invariant split is checkpoint-based, not runtime-gated

**Paraphrase.** RepoPact does not evaluate `g_done` (or any invariant) as a
runtime precondition on an edit. A user or agent can put the tree into an
invalid state with an ordinary `git mv`/file edit. RepoPact's enforcement
point is the *checkpoint* — validation, CI, review, generated reports — not
the edit itself.

**Source.** `paper.md` §3.2 ("Composition is checkpoint-based rather than
precondition-based... RepoPact's enforcement point is the checkpoint:
validation, CI, review, and generated reports"); `formal-model.md` §3
("Composition is checkpoint-based rather than precondition-based... L1
transitions freely; L2 decides admissibility at the commit boundary").

**Supporting observation.** Any case where an invalid edit is made, then
caught the next time `validate`/CI/`doctor` actually runs.

**Falsifying/narrowing observation.** A case where the checkpoint itself is
never exercised for an extended period, so "the point of enforcement" never
fires at all — this doesn't falsify C1 as *stated* (the paper never claims
the checkpoint fires automatically on a fixed cadence), but it exposes that
C1's safety property is conditional on *something* invoking the checkpoint,
which the model does not itself guarantee. This is the crux of the
"enforcement closure" question in `05-claim-evidence-matrix.md`.

**Preconditions required by the claim.** A checkpoint (validate, CI, review,
or a generated report someone reads) actually runs at some point before the
consequences of an invalid state compound. The paper does not state a bound
on how long a repository may go without a checkpoint running.

## C2 — T5, Monitor non-bypass, tagged `[ci]`

**Paraphrase.** "For any edit trace `s0 → s1 → ... → sk`, the checkpoint
admits `sk` iff `sk ∈ R`." Tagged `[ci]` = machine-checked on every run, and
`[conj]` for the adversarial negation (¬H4/¬H5).

**Source.** `paper.md` §3.3 and Appendix B, T5; `formal-model.md` §6, T5.

**Supporting observation.** A CI run that rejects a bad commit; a local
`validate` that rejects a bad state before push.

**Falsifying/narrowing observation.** A commit history in which CI is wired
(workflow files exist, reference "governance") but never actually invokes
`repopact validate`/`check-frozen`, so no commit is ever admitted-or-rejected
by the checkpoint — the checkpoint doesn't run, so T5's "admits iff conformant"
guarantee is vacuous for every commit in that window, not merely untested.
This does **not** falsify T5's conditional admission logic (T5 says nothing
about what happens when the checkpoint fails to execute at all); it narrows
what `[ci]` should be read to certify. Using the terminology fixed in
`05-claim-evidence-matrix.md`'s enforcement-closure definition: T5 as stated
covers checkpoint *effectiveness* (a failing result blocks admission) once
the checkpoint executes; `[ci]` ("machine-checked on every run") reads as
also promising checkpoint *coverage* and *invocation*, which the theorem
does not itself establish and this case study's evidence shows do not follow
automatically from adoption. A literal reading of `[ci]` presupposes CI
*performs* the check; a CI pipeline that exists but does not call the
validator is not covered by `[ci]`'s discharge, and the formal model does not
name this three-way distinction explicitly. See RepoPact's own
`research/gap-audit-2026-07.md` GA-3 and work item `032`
(`C:\\local-path-redacted) for a first-party instance of
the same higher-level failure class through a different mechanism: RepoPact's
own `main` branch has no branch protection requiring the governance workflow
to pass (a coverage/effectiveness gap), and the workflow itself was
billing-locked for over a month (an invocation gap) — distinct from
ForgeWire's mechanism, where CI ran on every push but its steps simply never
called the RepoPact CLI (a pure coverage gap, with invocation and
effectiveness never at issue because the check was never present to invoke).

**Preconditions required by the claim.** CI (or an equivalent checkpoint) is
(a) actually configured to invoke the validator, and (b) actually running,
and, per work item 032's own AC-3, (c) *required* by branch protection or an
equivalent merge gate — otherwise a failing checkpoint doesn't block anything
either.

## C3 — I_derive_dash: dashboard fixpoint is now validator-enforced, not CI-only (RepoPact 2.2.0)

**Paraphrase.** As of 2.2.0, `I_derive_dash(s) = exists(dashboard) and
read(dashboard) = π_dashboard(s)` is checked by the one-tree validator itself,
not only by a CI diff step. "This makes CI a redundant execution venue for the
dashboard fixpoint rather than its only enforcer."

**Source.** `paper.md` §3.5; `formal-model.md` §5 ("Since RepoPact 2.2.0,
dashboard equality is decided directly by the one-tree validator").

**Supporting observation.** `repopact validate` rejecting a stale dashboard
with no CI involved at all — reproduced directly in this case study (every
`repopact dashboard --root .` regeneration step in the ForgeWire WI236/237
session was required independently of CI, and `repopact validate` caught
staleness locally multiple times).

**Falsifying/narrowing observation.** None found. This is the one derive-layer
claim where RepoPact deliberately moved a check *out* of the CI-dependency
class and into the one-tree validator — i.e., RepoPact's own maintainers
already narrowed the CI-dependency surface for exactly one invariant (INV-7's
dashboard half) after presumably recognizing CI-availability risk. `spec`
projection equality (`SPEC.md`) remains generator/CI-checked only, per the
same section — narrower coverage than the dashboard case.

**Preconditions.** None beyond running `repopact validate` at all (locally or
in CI) — this is precisely why it is the strongest claim in the corpus:
it does not depend on CI being wired correctly.

## C4 — The concrete-record adoption trilemma and its provenance-typed resolution (T6a/T6b)

**Paraphrase.** No brownfield migration can be simultaneously total, faithful,
and closed under a concrete-only record language. RepoPact 2.0 resolves this
by adding `inferred`/`provisional` provenance types, so migration can be all
three under the provenance-aware language `R_p`, while `completed` work still
requires `concrete` evidence (P2/P3).

**Source.** `paper.md` §3.6, §4.3 (F-014's `waived` convention), Appendix B
T6a/T6b; `formal-model.md` §4 ("Adoption cannot preserve R: a trilemma");
`findings.md` F-010 (import-plan; completed items marked `waived`, "never as
`satisfied` with fabricated evidence").

**Supporting observation.** ForgeWire's own `REPOPACT-ADOPTION.md` states
exactly this convention verbatim ("Completed todos import as `status:
completed` with their acceptance criterion `waived`... never as `satisfied`
with fabricated evidence") and the WI236/237 session independently applied
the identical pattern when backfilling 8 unregistered work directories and
adding disclosed (non-backdated) preflight markers to 5 more — i.e., this is
a *live, still-operative* convention in the wild, not a one-time adoption
artifact.

**Falsifying/narrowing observation.** None found in this case study. This
claim was not under test by the WI230/236/237 incident — no adoption event
occurred during it; the trilemma concerns *migration*, and this incident is
about *post-adoption drift*, a different L1/L2 question. Out of scope for
this case study's central question (see `05-claim-evidence-matrix.md`).

**Preconditions.** A migration path (`adopt`/`import-plan`) is used, as
opposed to hand-authoring records — which is itself a distinct concern from
whether an *already-adopted* repository's validator is invoked going forward.

## C5 — H12 / S5: RepoPact lowers silent-staleness rate and detection latency for drift, "measured honestly against its own known blind spot" (F-011)

**Paraphrase.** RepoPact should surface documented-state-vs-code divergence
at commit/CI boundaries with *bounded* staleness; convention-file regimes
have no detection mechanism at all (detection ≈ 0 until a human notices).
RepoPact's own longitudinal-upgrade blind spot (F-011, and mutation M9 in the
drift harness) is explicitly reported rather than hidden.

**Source.** `protocol.md` H12/¬H12 (falsification #12: "RepoPact's
silent-staleness rate is no lower for a drift class (cf. the longitudinal
F-011 case)"); `benchmark-protocol.md` S5; `findings.md` F-011;
`C:\\local-path-redacted
(mutations M4, M5, M7, M9, explicitly labeled RepoPact blind spots/partials).

**Supporting observation.** Every mutation *other than* M4/M5/M7/M9 has a
concrete, named validator predicate that fires when `validate` is *run*.

**Falsifying/narrowing observation.** This is the central hit, but it needs
three distinct axes kept apart, which M1–M15 (and H12/S5 as currently
constructed) substantially collapse into one:

1. **Detection efficacy conditional on invocation** — when `validate` *is*
   run, does it correctly flag a given divergence? This is what M1–M3, M6,
   M8, M10–M12, M14–M15 measure, and what this case study's evidence
   confirms works well (see `04-forgewire-case-timeline.md`, `05`).
2. **Invocation latency or absence** — how long, and by what mechanism, does
   it take for `validate` to actually be *run* against a drifted state? This
   is only partially modeled (S5's `latency` field assumes some run-cadence
   to measure latency against; it does not model zero-cadence).
3. **Accumulated drift/error volume over time** — how much, and what kind of,
   divergence compounds across an extended zero-invocation window? Not
   modeled by any existing mutation.

RepoPact's own reported figures for this incident (`repopact validate`
reporting 269–297 repository-level errors at different points; WI230's own
closeout citing 26 errors attributable to its own record; see
`04-forgewire-case-timeline.md` for the full breakdown and the important
caveat that a substantial share of the 269-count, ~64%, is separately
attributable to a version-specific validator false-positive rather than
confirmed governance drift) are not a case of axis 1 failing — every
confirmed governance discrepancy this case study traced was correctly
flagged once `validate` ran. They are a case of axis 2/3: the validator was
not invoked at all as part of ordinary workflow for an extended period,
while unrelated architecture work proceeded and tests stayed green. This is
a *different* mechanism from F-011 (which is version-drift: an old adopter's
records go invalid as the *standard* evolves) and from M9 (same mechanism,
modeled as a mutation) — the standard did not change here, the repository
was never RepoPact-naive, but the checkpoint was simply not exercised as
part of the loop over an extended window. See `08-pactbench-coverage-gap.md`
for the precise gap this exposes in the mutation set, and
`05-claim-evidence-matrix.md` for the full classification.

**Preconditions.** H12 is stated as a claim about behavior "under RepoPact" —
which implicitly presumes RepoPact's validator is exercised at the boundaries
being compared. The claim does not have a stated precondition that the
validator must actually run for the comparison to be meaningful, which is
itself worth flagging (see `05`).

## C6 — F-008 (adopter `.gitignore` silently un-tracks `evidence/runs/*.json`)

**Paraphrase.** A pre-existing `.gitignore` rule intended for unrelated
runtime data (`runs/`) can silently match RepoPact's own evidence directory,
so the repo validates locally but breaks on a fresh clone or in CI, where the
ignored evidence is absent. "The most dangerous failure is one that passes
locally and breaks for everyone else." Fixed: `adopt` now runs
`git check-ignore` on every record it writes and warns.

**Source.** `paper.md` §6.1; `findings.md` F-008.

**Supporting observation.** ForgeWire's `REPOPACT-ADOPTION.md` documents
exactly this incident (finding F-008 upstream) and its fix (`!evidence/runs/`
negation).

**Falsifying/narrowing observation — the mirror-image gap.** F-008 is about
*governed* content becoming silently *invisible* to `git`/CI (undercounting).
The WI236/237 session found the structural inverse: *non-governed* content —
local `git worktree` checkouts under `.claude/worktrees/**` — becoming
falsely *visible* to `repopact validate`'s raw filesystem walk
(`repo_model.iter_contracts`'s hardcoded `IGNORED_PARTS` set:
`.git, __pycache__, node_modules, .venv, .pytest_cache, build, dist,
fixtures` in the pinned 2.2.0 ForgeWire consumed — no `.claude` or worktree
awareness), producing 171 of the 269 errors from AGENTS.md files inside
untracked worktree checkouts that were never part of the governed tree and
never affected CI. **Correction**: this specific gap was already fixed on
RepoPact's actual `origin/main` (`0096d70`, "exclude worktrees/ scratch
checkouts from contract scanning," merged 2026-07-28) three weeks before this
incident — ForgeWire's pin simply hadn't moved past 2.2.0. See
`03-version-delta.md` for the corrected classification: roughly two-thirds of
this incident's error volume is a version-currency gap, not a standing
RepoPact design gap, though the underlying mechanism (a literal path-segment
allowlist rather than genuine git-tracked-status awareness) is narrowed for
the one directory name this incident used, not closed structurally — a
worktree checked out under any other name would still reproduce the same
false positives in both 2.2.0 and current `origin/main`. F-008's mitigation
(`git check-ignore` at write-time) does not address this direction either
way: the validator's own directory walk has no concept of "untracked, not
part of any CI checkout" the way `git ls-files` or `.gitignore` awareness
would provide. See `03-version-delta.md` and `05-claim-evidence-matrix.md`.

**Preconditions.** The adopter's local disk state (worktrees, ignored dirs)
diverges from what CI actually checks out — true for any adopter that uses
`git worktree` for agent sessions, which the paper does not discuss as a
distinct adopter usage pattern.

## C7 — F-011 / GA-1: longitudinal upgrade drift is a documented, still-recurring blind spot

**Paraphrase.** An older adopter drifted invalid as the *standard* evolved
(stale registry paths, a missing root contract) and nothing detected or
guided the upgrade; `doctor` was built in response. RepoPact's own gap audit
(`gap-audit-2026-07.md`, GA-1) later found this recurring in the wild: on
2026-07-15, ForgeWire itself failed current validation with 39 errors
("16 × unknown affected_scope, preflight-marker drift, others" — "This is the
F-011 longitudinal-drift class recurring in the wild").

**Source.** `findings.md` F-011; `gap-audit-2026-07.md` GA-1 and its
2026-07-26 update.

**Supporting observation.** GA-1's own framing: "an opportunity: run `doctor`
upgrades on both and capture the episode as fresh T7/ratchet evidence... If
`doctor` cannot repair the unknown-scope class, that is a new honest finding
about `doctor` coverage."

**Falsifying/narrowing observation.** GA-1 predates the WI230 incident by
over a month (2026-07-15 vs. WI230's 2026-08-18 start) and documents *the
same repository* (ForgeWire) drifting invalid *twice*, independently, with
RepoPact's own research process as the discovery mechanism both times (not
ForgeWire's own CI). This means WI230/236/237 is not a first occurrence but
at minimum a second, later, larger recurrence (39 → 297 errors) of the exact
pattern RepoPact's own maintainers had already named and partially addressed
with `doctor`. Whether `doctor --fix` was actually run on ForgeWire between
GA-1 (2026-07-15) and WI230 (2026-08-18), and what its effect was, is not
established by this case study and is flagged as an open question in
`04-forgewire-case-timeline.md`.

**Preconditions.** `doctor` repairs a bounded class of drift (stale registry
paths, missing preflight markers, etc.) but does not address the invocation
gap itself — `doctor` still has to be *run* by someone, on some cadence, for
this mitigation to apply, which is the same "checkpoint must be invoked"
precondition as C1/C2.
